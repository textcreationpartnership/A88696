            <title>Vindiciæ contra tyrannos: a defence of liberty against tyrants. Or, of the lawfull power of the prince over the people, and of the people over the prince. Being a treatise written in Latin and French by Junius Brutus, and translated out of both into English. Questions discussed in this treatise. I. Whether subjects are bound, and ought to obey princes, if they command that which is against the law of God. II. Whether it be lawfull to resist a prince which doth infringe the law of God, or ruine the Church, by whom, how, and how farre it is lawfull. III. Whether it be lawfull to resist a prince which doth oppresse or ruine a publique state, and how farre such resistance may be extended, by whome, how, and by what right, or law it is permitted. IV. Whether neighbour princes or states may be, or are bound by law, to give succours to the subjects of other princes, afflicted to the cause of true religion, or oppressed by manifest tyranny.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The firſt Queſtion. <hi>Whether Subjects are bound and ought to obey Printes, if they command that which is againſt the Law of God.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS queſtion happily may ſeeme at the firſt view to be altogether ſuperfluous and unprofitable, for that it ſeems to make a doubt, of an axiome allways held in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible amongſt Chriſtians, confirmed by many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in Holy Scripture, divers examples of the hiſtories of all ages, and by the death of all the Holy Martyrs, for it may be well demanded wherefore Chriſtians have endured ſo many afflictions, but that they were alwayes perſwaded, that God muſt be obeyed ſimply, and abſolutly, and Kings with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that they command not that which is repugnant to the law of God. Otherways wherfore ſhould the Apoſtles have anſwered, that God muſt rather be obeyed than men, and alſo <note place="margin">Act. 4. 19.</note> ſeeing that the only wil of God is always juſt, and that of men may be, and is, oftentimes unjuſt, who can doubt but that we muſt always obey Gods commandements without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and mens ever with limitation. But for ſo much as there are many Princes in theſe days, calling themſelves Chriſtians, which arrogantly aſſumes an unlimited power, over which God himſelfe hath no command, and that they have no want of flatterers, which adore them as Gods upon earth, many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo, which for feare, or by conſtraint, either ſeem, or elſe do beleeve, that Princes ought to be obeyed in all things, and by all men. And withall, ſeeing the unhappines of theſe times is ſuch, that there is nothing ſo firme, certain, or pure, which is not ſhaken, diſgraced, or polluted; I feare me that whoſoever ſhall neerly, and throughly conſider theſe things, will confeſſe this queſtion to be not only moſt profitable, but alſo, the times conſidered, moſt neceſſary. For my owne part when I conſider the cauſe of the many calamities, wherewith Chriſtendome hath been afflicted, for theſe late yeares, I cannot but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that of the Prophet <hi>Hoſea, The Princes of Judah were like them</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 10. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>that remove the bounds: wherefore I will power out my ſelf like water. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim is oppreſſed, and broken in judgement, becauſe he willingly walked after the Commandement.</hi> Here you ſee the ſin of the Princes, and people diſperſed in theſe two words. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> The Princes exceed their bounds, not contenting themſelves with that authority which the Almighty, and all good God hath given them, but ſeeke to uſurpe that ſovereignty, which he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:124812:4"/> hath reſerved to himſelfe over all men, being not content to command the bodys, and goods of their Subjects at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but aſſume licence to themſelves to inforce the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which appertaines chiefly to Jeſus Chriſt, holding the earth not great enough for their ambition, they will climbe and conquor heaven it ſelfe. The people on the other ſide walkes after the commandement, when they yeeld to the deſire of Princes, who command them that which is againſt the law of God, and as it were burn incenſe to, and adore theſe earthy Gods; and inſtead of reſiſting them, if they have means and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; ſuffer them to uſurp the place of God, making no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to give that to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which belongs properly and only to God. Now is there any man that ſees not this, if a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey a Prince commanding that which is wicked and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, hee ſhall preſently bee eſteemed a Rebell, a Traytor, and guilty of High Treaſon, our Saviour Chriſt, the Apoſtles and all the Chriſtians of the Primitive Church were charged with theſe Calumnies. If any after the example of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> diſpoſe himſelfe to the building of the Temple of the <note place="margin">Ezra. 4. Nehe. 5 7.</note> Lord, It wil be ſaid he aſpires to the Crowne, hatches inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and ſeeks the ruine of the State, then you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſee a million of theſe Minnious, and flatterers of Princes tickling their eares with an opinion, that if they once ſuffer this Temple to be re-builded, they may bid their Kingdome farewell, and never look to raiſe impoſt or taxes on theſe men. But what a madneſſe is this? There are no eſtates which ought to be eſteemed firme and ſtable, but thoſe, in whom the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God is built, and which are indeed the Temple it ſelfe, and theſe we may truly call Kings, which reigne with God, ſeeing that it is by him only that Kings reign: On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry what beaſtly fooliſhneſſe is it to think, that the State and Kingdome cannot ſubſiſt if God Almighty be not excluded, and his Temple demoliſhed. From hence proceeds ſo many Tyrannous enterpriſes, unhappy and tragick death of Kings, and ruines of people. If theſe Sicophants knew what difference there is between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> between the King of Kings, and a ſimple King, between the Lord, and the Vaſſal, and what tributs this Lord requires of his Subjects, and what authority he gives to Kings over thoſe his Subjects, certainly ſo many Princes would not ſtrive to trouble the Kingdome of God, and we ſhould not ſee ſome of them precipitated from their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124812:4"/> Throns by the juſt inſtigation of the Almighty, revenging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of them, in the midſt of their greateſt ſtrength, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould not be ſo ſack't and pillag'd, and troden down.</p>
               <p>It then belongs to Princes to know how farre they may extend their authority, and to ſubjects in what they may obey them, leſt the one incroaching on that juriſdiction, which no way belongs to them, and the others obeying him which commandeth further then he ought, they be both chaſtiſed, when they ſhall give an account thereof before another Judge: Now the end and ſcope of the queſtion propounded, whereof the Holy Scripture ſhall principally give the reſolution, is that which followeth. The queſtion is, if ſubjects be bound to obey Kings, in caſe they command that which is againſt the Law of God: that is to ſay, to which of the two (God or the King) muſt we rather obey, when the queſtion ſhall be reſolved concerning the King, to whom is attributed abſolute power, that concerning other Magiſtrates ſhall be alſo determined.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Holy Scripture doth teach, that God reignes by his owne proper authority, and Kings by derivation, God from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Kings from God, that God hath a juriſdiction proper, Kings <note place="margin">Prov. 8. Iob 12. Wiſd. 6. 3.</note> are his delegates: It followes then, that the juriſdiction of God hath no limits, that of Kings bounded, that the power of God is infinit, that of Kings confin'd, that the Kingdom of God extends it ſelfe to all places, that of Kings is reſtrain'd within the confines of certaine countries: In like manner God hath created of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing both heaven, and earth; wherefore by good right he is Lord, and true Proprietorie, both of the one, and the other: All the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth hold of him that which they have, and are but his tenants, and farmers; all the Princes and Governors of the world are his ſtipendaries, and vaſſals, and are bound to take and acknowledge their inveſtitures from him.

Then therefore all Kings are the Vaſſals of the King of Kings, inveſted into their Office by the ſword, which is the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of their royall authority, to the end, that with the ſword they maintaine the Law of God, defend the good, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the evill: Even as we commonly ſee, that he which is a ſovereigne Lord, puts his Vaſſals into poſſeſſion of their fee, by girding them with a ſword, delivering them a buckler, and a ſtandard, with condition that they ſhall fight for them with thoſe armes if occaſion ſhall ſerve. Now if we conſider what is the duty of Vaſſalls, we ſhall find that what may be ſaid of them, agrees properly to Kings. The Vaſſall receives his fee of his Lord with right of juſtice, and charge to ſerve him in <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. and 9 20.</note> his warres. The King is eſtabliſhed by the Lord God, the King of Kings; to the end he ſhould adminiſter juſtice to his people and defend them againſt all their enemies. The Vaſſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives law and conditions from his Sovereigne: God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the King to obſerve his laws and to have them always before his eyes, promiſing that he and his ſucceſſors ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe long the Kingdom, if they be obedient, and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, rebellious to their Sovereigne King. The Vaſſall obligeth that their reigne ſhall be of ſmall continuance, if they prove himſelfe by Oath unto his Lord, and ſweares that he will be faithfull, and obedient: In like manner the King promiſeth ſolemnly to command, according to the expreſſe Law of God. <note place="margin">Deu. 17. 19.</note> Briefly the Vaſſall looſeth his fee, if he commit fellony, and by law forfeiteth all his priviledges: In the like caſe the King looſeth his Right, and many times his Realme alſo, if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe God, if he complot with his enemies, and if he commit fellony againſt that Royall Majeſty, this will appeare more clearely by the conſideration of the Covenant which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted between God and the King, for God does that honour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124812:6"/> to his ſervants to call them his confederats. Now we reade of two ſorts of Covenants at the Inaugurating of Kings, the firſt betweene God, the King, and the People, that the people might be the people of God: The ſecond between the King and the people, that the people ſhall obey faithfully, and the King command juſtly, we will treat hereafter of the ſecond, and now ſpeak of the firſt:</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Joas</hi> was crowned we read that a Covenant was contracted between God, the King, and the People: or, as it is <note place="margin">The Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Kings. 2 King. 11. 2 Chro. 23. 16. 2 king. 23.</note> ſaid in another place between <hi>Jehojada</hi> the High-Prieſt, all the People, and the King, <hi>That God ſhould bee their Lord.</hi> In like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner we read that <hi>Joſias</hi> and all the people entred into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants with the Lord: we may gather from theſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that in paſſing theſe Covenants the High-Prieſt did Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the name of God in expreſſe termes, that the King and the people ſhould take order that God might be ſerved purely, and according to his will, throughout the whole Kingdome of <hi>Juda,</hi> that the King ſhould ſo reigne that the people were ſuffered to ſerve God, and held in obedience to his law: That the people ſhould ſo obey the King, as their obedience ſhould have principall relation to God. It appeares by this that the King &amp; the people are joyntly bound by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and did obleige themſelves by ſolemn Oath to ſerve God before al things. And indeed preſently after they had ſworn the Covenant, <hi>Joſias</hi> and <hi>Joas</hi> did ruine the Idolatry of <hi>Baal</hi> and re-eſtabliſhed the pure ſervice of God. The principall poynts of the Covenants were cheifly theſe.</p>
               <p>That the King himſelfe, and all the people ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to honour and ſerve God according to his will revealed in his word, which if they performed, God would aſſiſt and preſerve their eſtates: as in doing the contrary, he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon, and exterminate them, which doth plainly appeare <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 30. 31.

Sommarily, he aſſures them all proſperity, if they obſerved the Law; as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways, he expreſly declared, that in doing the contrary they ſhould bee utterly ruined: Alſo at all ſuch times as they left the ſervice of God, they were delivered into the hands of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and reduced in to ſlavery, under their Tyranny. Now this Covenant between God and the people in the times of the Judges, had vigor alſo in the times of the Kings, and was treated with them. After that <hi>Saul</hi> had been anoynted, choſen, and wholly eſtabliſhed King, <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpeakes unto the people in theſe termes; <hi>Behold the King whom you have demanded</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>and choſen, God hath eſtabliſhed him King over you, obey you therefore and ſerve the Lord, as well you, as your King which is eſtabliſhed over you, otherwiſe you and your King ſhall periſh.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, you would have a King and God hath given you this here, notwithſtanding thinke not that God will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any encroachment upon his right, but know that the King is as well bound to obſerve the Law as you, and if he faile therein, his delinquency ſhall be puniſhed as ſeverely as yours: Briefly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your deſires <hi>Saul</hi> is given you for your King, to lead you in the wars, but with this condition annexed, that he himſelf follow the Law of God. After that <hi>Saul</hi> was rejected, becauſe he kept not <note place="margin">2 king. 2. 4. &amp; 6. 12.</note> his promiſe, <hi>David</hi> was eſtabliſhed King on the ſame condition, ſo alſo was his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> for the Lord ſaid, <hi>If thou keep my Law, I will confirm with thee the Covenant which I contracted with David.</hi> Now concerning this Covenant, it is inſerted into the ſecond book of the Chronicles, as followeth. <hi>There ſhall not faile there a man in my ſight, to ſit upon the Throne of Iſrael: yet ſo that thy children take heed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 6. 16. &amp; 7. 17. 2 king. 33. 2. Deut 17. 18 1 Sam. 10. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>to their way to walk in my Law, as thou haſt walked before me. But if they ſerve Idols, I will drive them from the Land whereof I have given them poſſeſſion.</hi> And therefore it was that the book of the Law was called the book of the Covenant of the Lord, (who commanded the Prieſts to give it the King) according to which <hi>Samuel</hi> put it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:124812:7"/> into the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> and according to the tenure thereof <hi>Joſias</hi> yeelds himſelf <hi>ſoedetarie</hi> and vaſſal of the Lord. Alſo the Law which is kept in the Ark, is called the Covenant of the Lord with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael. Finally, the people delivered from the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> doe renew the Covenant with God, and do acknowledge <note place="margin">2 Chron. 6 11. Nehem. 9 38.</note> throughout that Chapter, that they worthily deſerved all thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for their falſifying their promiſe to God. It appears then that the Kings ſwear as vaſſals to obſerve the Law of God, whom they confeſſe to be Sovereign Lord over all, Now accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which we have already touched, if they violate their Oath, and tranſgreſſe the law, we ſay that they have loſt their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as vaſſalls looſe their fee by committing fellony. We have ſaid that there was the ſame covenant between God and the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> as before, between God and the people in the times of <note place="margin">Jud. 2. 24 &amp; 4. 2. &amp;c. &amp; 9. 33. 1 Sam. 13. 13. &amp; 15. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Judges. But we ſee in many places, that when the people hath deſpiſed the Law, or made covenants with <hi>Baal,</hi> God hath delivered them into the hands of <hi>Eglon, Jabin,</hi> and other Kings of the <hi>Canaanites:</hi> And as it is one and the ſame Covenant, ſo thoſe which do break it, receive like puniſhment. <hi>Saul</hi> is ſo auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to ſacrifice, infringing thereby the Law of God, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after ſaves the life of <hi>Agag,</hi> King of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> againſt the expreſſe Commandement of God, for this occaſion he is called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and finally is chaſtized for his Rebellion. <hi>Thou haſt ſacrificed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but thou hadst done better to obey God, for, obedience is more worthy than ſacrifice.</hi> Thou haſt neglected the Lord thy God, he alſo hath rejected thee, that thou Reign no more over <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> This hath been ſo certainly obſerved by the Lord, that the very children of <hi>Saul</hi> were deprived of their paternall inheritance, for that he having committed high Treaſon, did thereby incurre the puniſhment of Tirants, which affect a Kingdom that no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains unto them. And not only the Kings, but alſo their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſucceſſors have been deprived of the Kingdome by reaſon of ſuch fellony. <hi>Solomon</hi> revolted from God to worſhip Idols. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently the Prophet <hi>Abijah</hi> foretels that the Kingdome ſhall be divided under his Son <hi>Rehoboam.</hi> Finally, the word of the Lord is accompliſhed, and ten Tribes which made the greateſt portion of the Kingdome, doe quit <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and adhere to <hi>Jeroboam</hi> his ſervant. Wherefore is this? for ſo much (ſaith the Lord) that they have left me to goe after <hi>Aſtoroche,</hi> the God of the Sidoniens and <hi>Chamos</hi> the God of the <hi>Moabites, &amp;c.</hi> I will alſo break in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:124812:8"/> peeces their Kingdome: as if he ſhould ſay, they have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Covenant, and have not kept promiſe, I am no more then tied unto them, they will leſſen my majeſty, and I will leſſen their Kingdome: Although they be my ſervants, yet notwithſtanding they will expel me my Kingdome; but I will drive them out themſelves by <hi>Jeroboham</hi> which is their ſervant. Furthermore, for ſo much as this ſervant, fearing that the ten tribes for the cauſe of Religion ſhould returne to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſet up Calves in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin, withdrawing by this meanes the people far from God, what was the puniſhment of ſo ingratfull a Vaſſall and wicked Traytor towards his Lord? Firſt, his ſon died, and in the end all his race, even unto the laſt of the males was taken from the face of the earth by the ſword of <hi>Baaſa,</hi> according to the judgement which was pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by the Prophet, becauſe he revolted from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Lord God: this then is cauſe ſufficient, &amp; often times alſo propounded, for the which God doth take from the King his fee, when he oppoſeth the Law of God, &amp; withdraws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from him to follow his enemies, to wit Idols, and as like crimes deſerve like puniſhments, we read in the holy Hiſtories that Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and of <hi>Juda</hi> which have ſo far forgotten themſelves, have in the end miſerably periſhed. Now although the forme both of the Church, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kingdome be changed, for that that which was before incloſed within the narrow bounds of <hi>Judea,</hi> is now dilated throughout the whole World, notwithſtanding the ſame things may be ſaid of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings, the Goſpell having ſucceeded the Law, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes being in the place of thoſe of <hi>Jury:</hi> There is the ſame Covenant, the ſame Conditions, the ſame Puniſhments, and if they faile in the accompliſhing, the ſame God Almighty revenger of all perfidious diſloyalty; and as the former were bound to keep the Law, ſo the other are obliged to adhere to the doctrine of the Goſpel, for the advancement whereof theſe Kings at their anoynting, and receiving, doe promiſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the utmoſt of their means.</p>

If the Prince commands to cut the throat of an innocent, to pillage and commit extortion, there is no man (provided he have ſome feeling of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) that would execute ſuch a commandement. If the Prince have committed ſome crime, as Adultery, Parricide, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wickedneſſe, behold amongſt the Heathen <hi>the learned Lawyer</hi> Papinian <hi>which will reprove</hi> Caracalla <hi>to his face,</hi> and had rather die then obey, when his cruell Prince commands him to lie and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate his offence; nay, although hee threaten him with a terrible death, yet would he not beare falſe witneſſe; what ſhall we then doe, if the Prince commands us to be Idolaters, if he would have us againe crucifie Chriſt Jeſus, if he enjoyns to blaſpheme and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite God, and to drive him (if it were poſſible) out of Heaven, is there not yet more reaſon to diſobey him, then to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuch extravagants commands: Yet a little further, ſeeing it is not ſufficient to abſtaine from evill, but that we muſt do good, inſtead of worſhipping of Idols, wee muſt adore and ſerve the true God, according as he hath commanded us, and inſtead of bending our knees before <hi>Baal,</hi> we muſt render to the Lord the honor and ſervice which he requires of us; for wee are bound to ſerve God for his owne ſake only: but we honour our Prince, and love our Neighbour, becauſe and for the love of God. Now if it be ill done to offend our neighbour, and if it be a capitall crime to riſe againſt our Prince, how ſhall we intitle thoſe that riſe in rebellion againſt the Majeſty of the Soveraigne Lord of all Manking; briefly,

               <head>The ſecond Queſtion, <hi>Whether it be lawfull to reſiſt a Prince which doth infringe the Law of God, or ruine his Church, by whom, how, and how far it is lawfull.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Queſtion ſeems at the firſt view to be of a high and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult nature, for ſo much as there being ſmall occaſion to ſpeak to Princes that fear God: On the contrary, there will be much danger to trouble the ears of thoſe which acknowledge no other Sovereign but themſelves, for which reaſon few or none have medled with it, and if any have at all touched it, it hath been but as it were in paſſing by. The Queſtion is, <hi>If it be lawfull to reſiſt a Prince violating the Law of God, or ruinating the Church, or hindring the reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it?</hi> If we hold our ſelves to the tenure of the holy Scripture, it will reſolve us. For, if in this caſe it have been lawfull to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh people (the which may be eaſily gathered from the books of the Old Teſtament) yea, if it have been injoyned them, I beleeve it will not be denyed, that the ſame muſt be allowed to the whole people of any Chriſtian Kingdom or Country whatſoever. In the firſt place it muſt be conſidered, that God having choſen <hi>Iſrael</hi> from amongſt all the Nations of the Earth, to be a peculiar people to him, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with them, that they ſhould be the people of God. This is written in divers places of <hi>Douteronomy:</hi> the ſubſtance and tenor of <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 6. &amp; 14. 2.</note> this alliance was, <hi>That all ſhould be carefull in their ſeverall lines, tribes, and families in the land of Canaan, to ſerve God purely, who would have a</hi>

                  <hi>Church eſtabliſhed amongſt them for ever,</hi> which may be drawn from the teſtimony of divers places, namely that which is contained in the 27 Chap. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> there <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Levites covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in the name of God, aſſembled all the people, and ſaid unto them: <hi>This day Oh Iſrael art thou become the people of God, obey you ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his voyce, &amp;c. And Moſes ſaid, when thou haſt paſſed the River of Jordan, thou ſhalt ſet ſix Tribes on the mountain of Gerizzim on the one ſide, and the ſix other on the Mountain of Eball, and then the Levites ſhall read the Law of God, promiſing the obſervers all felicity, and threatning woe and deſtruction to the breakers thereof, and all the people ſhall anſwer, Amen.</hi> The which was afterwards performed by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſome few days before his death. We ſee by this that all the people is bound to maintain the law of <note place="margin">Joſ. 5. 24. &amp; 24. 20. &amp;c.</note> God to perfect his Church: and on the contrary to exterminate the Idols of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Covenant which can no wayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to particulars, but only to the whole body of the people. To which alſo it ſeems the incamping of all the Tribes round about the Ark of the Lord, to have reference, to the end that all ſhould look to preſervation of that which was committed to the cuſtody of all. Now for the uſe and practiſe of this Covenant wee may produce examples, the Inhabitants of <hi>Gabaa</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed the wife of a <hi>Levite,</hi> which died through their violence. <note place="margin">Judg. 19, 20.</note> The <hi>Levite</hi> divided his wife into twelve peeces and ſent them to the twelve Tribes, to the end that all the people together might wipe away this ſo horrible a crime committed in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> All the people met together at <hi>Mizpah</hi> and required the <hi>Benjamites</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to be puniſhed thoſe that were culpable of this enormious crime, which they refuſed to performe, wherefore with the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God himſelfe, the ſtates of the people with an univerſall conſent renounce and make war againſt the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> and by this means the authority of the ſecond Table of the Law was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the detriment and ruine of one entire Tribe which had broken it in one of the precepts. For the firſt we have an example ſufficiently manifeſt in <hi>Joſhua.</hi> After that the <hi>Rubenites, Gadites,</hi> &amp; <hi>Manaſſites</hi> were returned into their dwellings beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> they incontinently built a goodly Alter neer unto the river, this ſeems <note place="margin">Joſ. 22</note> to contrary the commandement of the Lord, who expreſly forbids to ſacrifice any where but in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> only, wherefore it was to be feared leaſt theſe men intended to ſerve Idols. This bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe being communicated to the people, inhabiting on this ſide <hi>Jordan:</hi> the place aſſigned for the meetings of the States was at
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:124812:13"/> 
                  <hi>Silo</hi> where the Arke of the Lord was. They all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly met, and <hi>Phineas</hi> the High-Prieſt the ſon of <hi>Eleazer</hi> was ſent to the other to treate with them concerning this offence committed againſt the Law: And to the end they might know all the people had a hand in this buſineſſe, they ſent alſo the principall men of every Tribe to complain that the ſervice of God is corrupted, by this deviſe, that God would be provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this rebellion, and become an enemy, not only to the guilty, but alſo to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as heretofore in <hi>Beelphegor.</hi> Briefly that they ſhould denounce open warre againſt them if they deſiſted not from this their manner of doing: There muſt of neceſſity have followed much miſcheife, if thoſe Tribes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Jordan</hi> had not proteſted, that they erected that Alter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a memoriall that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> both on the one and the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> both did and do profeſſe one and the ſame Religion: and at all times whenſoever, they have ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves negligent in the maintenance of the ſervice of God, wee have ſeene that they have ever been puniſhed: This is the true cauſe wherefore they loſt two battels againſt the <hi>Benjamites</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it appeares in the end of the booke of <hi>Judges,</hi> for in ſo carefully undertaking to puniſh the rape and outrage don to a particular perſon, they clearly convinced themſelves of much negligent prophaneſſe in the maintenance of Gods right, by their continually negligence, omiſſion to puniſh both corporall and ſpirituall whoredomes, there was then in theſe firſt times ſuch a Covenant between God and the People.</p>
               <p>Now after that Kings were given unto the people, there was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God the king &amp; the people. 2 king. 11. 17. &amp; 23. 3.</note> ſo little purpoſe of diſannulling or disbanding the former contract, that it was renewed and confirmed for ever. Wee have formerly ſaid at the Inaugurating of Kings, there was a double Covenant treated of, to wit, <hi>between God, and the King; and betweene God, and the People.</hi> The agreement was firſt paſſed between <hi>God, the King, and the People:</hi> Or between <hi>the High-Prieſt the People,</hi> (which is named in the firſt place in the 23 Chapter in the 2 booke of the <hi>Chronicles) and the King.</hi> The intention <note place="margin">2 chron. 23 16.</note> of this was, that the <hi>people ſhould be the people of God,</hi> (which is as much as to ſay) <hi>that the people ſhould be the church of God,</hi> we have ſhewed before to what end God contracted Covenants with the King: Let us now conſider wherfore alſo he allies himſelfe with the people. It is a thing moſt certaine, that God hath not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:124812:14"/> done this in vain, and if the people had not <hi>authority to promiſe, and to keep promiſe,</hi> it were vainly loſt time to contract or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them. It may ſeem then that God hath done like thoſe creditors, which having to deale with not very ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent borrowers, take divers joyntly bound for one and the ſame ſum, inſomuch as two or more being bound one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother and each of them apart, for the intire payment of the totall ſum, he may demand his whole debt of which of them he pleaſeth. There was much danger to commit the cuſtody of the Church to one man <hi>alone,</hi> and therefore God did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and put it in truſt <hi>to all the people:</hi> The King being raiſed to ſo ſlippery a place might eaſily be corrupted, for feare leaſt the Church ſhould ſtumble with him, God would have the people alſo to be reſpondents for it. In the Covenant of which we ſpeak, <hi>God,</hi> or (in his place) the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> are ſtipulators, the King and all the people, to wit, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> doe joyntly and voluntarily aſſume, promiſe, and oblige themſelves for one and the ſame thing. The High-Prieſt demands if they promiſe that the people ſhall bee the people of God, that God ſhall always have his Temple, his Church amongſt them, where he ſhallbe purely ſerved, The King is reſpondent, ſo alſo are the people (the whole body of the people repreſenting as it were the office and place of one man) not ſeverally, but joyntly, as the words themſelves make cleare, being incontinent, and not by intermiſſion or diſtance of time the one after the other. <note place="margin">L.

                  <hi>like manner, as when two men that are indebted, eſpecially to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Exchequer, the one is in ſuch manner bound for the other, that he can</hi>

                  <hi>take no benefit of the diviſion granted; by the new Conſtitutions of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian: So likewiſe the King and Iſrael promiſing to pay tribute to God, which is the King of Kings, for accompliſhment whereof, the one is obliged for the other.

                  <hi>this is here, the failings of the one indammageth the other: ſo that if Iſrael forſake their God, and the King makes no account of it, he is juſtly guilty of Iſraels delinquency. In like manner, if the King follow after ſtrange gods, and not content to be ſeduced himſelf, ſeeks alſo to attract his Subjects, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring by all means to ruine the Church, if Iſrael ſeek not to withdraw him from his rebellion, and contain him within the limits of obedience, they make the fault of their King, their own tranſgreſſion.</hi> Briefly, as when there is danger that one of the debtors by conſuming his goods may be diſabled to give ſatisfaction, the other muſt ſatisfie the creditors who ought not to be endamaged, though one of his debtors have ill husbanded his eſtate, this ought not to be doubted in regard of <hi>Iſrael</hi> toward their King, and of the King towards <hi>Iſrael</hi> in caſe one of them apply himſelfe to the ſervice of Idols, or breake their Covenant in any other ſort, the one of them muſt pay the forfeiture and be puniſhed for the other. Now that the Covenants of which we at this time treat, is of this nature, it appeares alſo by other teſtimonies of Holy Scripture. <hi>Saul</hi> being eſtabliſhed King of <hi>Iſrael, Samuel</hi> Prieſt <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 14. 25.</note> and Prophet of the Lord, ſpeakes in this manner to the people. <hi>Both you and your King which is over you ſerve the Lord your God, but if you perſevere in malice</hi> (he taxeth them of malice for that they preferred the government of a man before that of God) <hi>you and your King ſhall periſh,</hi> He adds after the reaſon, <hi>For it hath pleaſed God to chuſe you for his people.</hi> You ſee here both the parties evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conjoyned in the condition and the puniſhment: In like manner <hi>Aſa</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> by the counſel of the Prophet <hi>Azarie,</hi> aſſembleth all the people at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to wit, <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> to enter into Covenant with God. Thither came alſo divers of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim, Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> which were come thither to ſerve the Lord according to his own ordinance After the ſacrifices were performed according to the Law, the Covenant was contracted in theſe termes, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not call upon the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>be he the leaſt or the greateſt, let him dye the death.</hi> In making mention of the greateſt, you ſee that the King himſelfe is not excepted from the deſigned puniſhment.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:124812:15"/>
               <p>But who may puniſh the King (for here is queſtion of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <note place="margin">2 king. 23. 2.</note> and temporall puniſhment?) If it be not the whole body of the people to whom the King ſweareth and obligeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, no more nor leſſe, than the people doe to the King, we read alſo that King <hi>Joſias</hi> being of the age of twenty and <note place="margin">2 Chron. 4. 29.</note> five yeares, together with the whole people, doth make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Lord, the King and the People promiſing to keepe the Lawes, and Ordinances of God, and even then for the better accompliſhing of the tenour of this agreement, the Idolatry of <hi>Baall</hi> was preſently deſtroyed. If any will more exactly turne over the holy Bible, he may well finde other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe ſhould the conſent of the people be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, wherefore ſhould <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Juda</hi> be expreſly bound to obſerve the Law of God? for what reaſon ſhould they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo ſolemnly to be for ever the people of God? If it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, by the ſame reaſon that they had any authority from God, or power to free themſelves from perjury, or to hinder the ruine of the Church. For to what end ſhould it ſerve to cauſe the people to promiſe to be the people of God, if they muſt, and are bound to endure and ſuffer the King to draw them after ſtrange Gods. If the people be abſolutly in bondage wherefore is it commanded then, to take order that God be purely ſerved? if it be ſo that they cannot properly oblige themſelves to God, and if it be not lawfull for them by all to indeavour the accompliſhment of their promiſe, ſhall we ſay that God hath made an agreement with them, which had <note place="margin">I. quod at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But on the contrary, in this buſineſſe of making a Covenant with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, God would openly and plainly ſhow, that the people hath right to make, hold, and accompliſh their promiſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts. For, if he be not worthy to be heard in publique Court that will bargaine or contract with a ſlave, or one that is under tutillage, ſhall it not be much more ſhamefull to lay this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation upon the Almighty, that he ſhould contract with thoſe which had no power to performe the conditions covenanted? But for this occaſion it was, that when the Kings had broken their Covenants, the Prophets always addreſſed themſelves to the houſe of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to <hi>Samaria,</hi> to advertiſe them of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Furthermore, they required the people that they not only
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:124812:15"/> with-draw themſelves from ſacrificing to <hi>Baal,</hi> but alſo that they caſt down his Idoll, and deſtroy his Prieſts and ſervice; yea, even <hi>maugre the King</hi> himſelfe. For example, <hi>Ahab</hi> having killed the Prophets of God, the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> aſſembleth the people, and as it were convented the Eſtates, and doth there taxe, reprehend, and reprove every one of them; the people at his exhortation doe take and put to death the Prieſts of <hi>Baal.</hi> And for ſo much as the King neglected his duty, it behoved <hi>Iſrael</hi> more carefully to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge theirs without tumult, not raſhly, but by <hi>publicke authority,</hi> the Eſtates being aſſembled, and the equity of the cauſe orderly debated, and ſufficiently cleared before they came to the execution of juſtice. On the contrary, ſo often, and always when <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath fayled to oppoſe their King, which would overthrow the ſervice of God, that which hath been formerly ſaid of the two Debtors, the inability and ill husbandry of the one doth ever prejudice the other, the ſame hapned to them; for as the King hath been puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for his Idolatry and Diſloyaltie, the people have alſo beene chaſtiſed for their negligence, connivencie, and ſtupidity, and it hath commonly hapned, that the Kings have bin much more often ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and drawn others with them then the people, for ſo much as ordinarily the great ones mould themſelves into the faſhion of the King, and the people conforme themſelves in humours to thoſe that governe them: to be briefe, all more uſually offend after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of one, then that one will reform himſelfe as he ſeeth all the reſt. This which we ſay will perhaps appeare more plainly by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; what doe we ſuppoſe to have been the cauſe of the defeat and overthrow of the Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with their King <hi>Saul.</hi> Doth God correct the people for the ſinnes of the Prince? Is the child <note place="margin">1 Sam. 31.</note> beaten inſtead of the Father? It is a diſcourſe not eaſily to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, ſay the Civilians, to maintain that the children ſhould bear the puniſhments due for the offences of their Fathers; the Laws doe not permit that any one ſhall ſuffer for the wickedneſſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Now God forbid that the Judge of all the world (ſaith <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 25. Deut. 24. 16. 2 King. 14 6. Ezech. 18. 20.</note>

                  <hi>Saul,</hi> when he violated the Law of God; but applauded that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Prince when he wickedly perſecuted the beſt men, as <hi>David</hi> and the Prieſts of the Lord. Amongſt many other examples let us onely produce ſome few. The ſame <hi>Saul</hi> to enlarge the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> broke the publick faith granted to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> at the firſt entry of the people into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>

In the mean time, after the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> being eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed King, the Lord being demanded, made anſwer, that it was already the third yeare that the whole countrey of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with famine, becauſe of this cruelty, and the hand of the Lord ceaſed not to ſtrike, untill that ſeven men of the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> were given to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who put them to death; ſeeing <note place="margin">L. <hi>crimen.</hi> 26. <hi>D. de pae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Furthermore, in ſo much as it is the duty of a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, rather to endeavour to hinder and prevent a miſchiefe, then to chaſtiſe the delinquents after the offence is committed, as good Phyſicians that preſcribe a diet to allay and prevent diſeaſes, as wel as medicines to cure them: In like manner a people truly affected to true religion, will not ſimply conſent themſelves to reprove and repreſſe a Prince that would aboliſh the Law of God, but alſo will have ſpeciall regard, that through malice and wickedneſſe he inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate nothing that may hurt the ſame, or that in tract of time may

               <p>But I ſee well, here will be an objection made, what will you ſay? That a whole people, that beaſt of many heads, muſt they run <note place="margin">Dominus l. 1.

In like manner and all Iſrael was aſſembled, or all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> &amp;c. Now it is no way probable that all the people one by one met together there. Of this ranck there are in every well governd Kingdom, the Princes, the Officers of the Crown, the Peers, the greateſt and moſt notable Lords, the Deputies of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, of whom the ordinary body of the Eſtate is compoſed, or the Parliament, or the Diet, or other Aſſembly according to the different names uſed in divers Countries of the world, in which Aſſemblies the principall care is had both for the preventing and reforming either of diſorder or detriment in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For as the Counſels of Baſil and Conſtance have decreed (and well decreed) that the univerſal Councel is in Authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Biſhop of Rome.

And for ſo much as an orderly proceeding is neceſſarily required in all affairs diſcreetly addreſſed, and that it is not ſo probably hopefull that order ſhall be obſerved amongſt ſo great a number of people; yea, and that there oftentimes occurs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions which may not be communicated to a multitude, without manifeſt danger of the Common-wealth. We ſay, that all that which hath been ſpoken of priviledges granted, and right committed to the people, ought to be referred to the Officers and Deputies of the Kingdom: and all that which hath been ſaid of Iſrael, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Princes and Elders of Iſrael, to whom theſe things were granted and committed as the practice alſo hath verified.</p>

Let us put the caſe that a King ſeeking to aboliſh the Law of God, or ruine the Church, that all the people or the greateſt part yeild their conſents, that all the Princes or the greateſt number of them make no reckoniug; and notwithſtanding, a ſmall handfull of people, to wit, ſome of the Princes and Magiſtrates deſire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Law of God entirely and inviolably, and to ſerve the Lord purely: what may it be lawfull for them to do? if the King ſeek to compel thoſe men to be Idolaters, ot will take from them the exerciſe of true religion? We ſpeak not here of private and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons conſidered one by one, and which in that manner are not held as parts of the entire body; As the planks, the nails, the pegs, are no part of the Ship, neither the ſtones, the rafters, nor the rubbiſh are any part of the houſe: but we ſpeak of ſome Town or Province, which makes a portion of a Kingdom, as the prow, the poop, the keel and other parts make a Ship: the foundation, the roof, and the walls make a houſe. We ſpeak alſo of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate which governs ſuch a Citie or Province. If we muſt make our defence with producing of examples, although we have not many ready by reaſon of the backwardneſs and careleſneſs of men when there is queſtion to maintain the ſervice of God: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we have ſome few to be examined and received accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they deſerve. <hi>Libna,</hi> a Town of the Prieſts withdrew it <note place="margin">Iohn 21 13. 1 Chron. 6. 17. 2 Chron. 21. 10.</note> ſelf from the obedience of <hi>Joram</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and left that Prince, becauſe he had abandoned the God of his Fathers whom thoſe of that Town would ſerve, and it may be they feared alſo leſt in the end they ſhould be compelled to ſacrifice to <hi>Baal.</hi> In like manner when that the King <hi>Antiochus</hi> commanded that all the Jews ſhould imbrace his religion, and ſhould forſake that which the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:124812:19"/> God Almighty had taught them, <hi>Mattathias</hi> anſwered, we will not <note place="margin">1 Mac 1. 43. &amp; 2. 22. &amp; 3. 43.</note> obey, nor will we do any thing contrary to our religion, neither did he only ſpeak, but alſo being tranſported with the zeal of <hi>Phineas,</hi> he killed with his own hands a Jew, which conſtrained his fellow Citizens to ſacrifice to Idols; then he took arms and retired into the mountain, gathered troups, and made war againſt <hi>Antiochu,</hi> for Religion, and for his Countrie with ſuch ſucceſs, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> brok and brought to nothing the power of the Pagans which they had gathered to ruine the Church, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed the pure ſervice of God. If we will know who this <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> was, he was the Father of the <hi>Machabees</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> inſomuch as it was not lawfull for him according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived cuſtome and right of his race to reſtore the Kingdom by arms from the Tyranny of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> His followers were ſuch as fled to the mountains together, with the inhabitants of <hi>Modin,</hi> to whom had adjoyned themſelves divers neighboring Jews, and other fugitives from ſundry quarters of <hi>Iudeah;</hi> all which ſolicitouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the re-eſtabliſhment of the Church. Almoſt all the reſt, yea, the principals obeyed <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and that after the rout of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and his own miſerable death: Although there were then a fair <note place="margin">1 Mac. 6. 21. &amp;c.</note> occaſion to ſhake off his yoke, yet the Jewes ſought to the ſonne of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and intreated him to take on him the Kingdom, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him fidelity and obedience. I might here produce the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Debora.</hi> The Lord God had ſubjected <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Iabin</hi> King of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they had remained in this ſervitude the ſpace of twenty years, which might ſeem in ſome ſort to have gained a right by preſcription over the Kingdom; and together alſo that almoſt all <hi>Iſrael</hi> followed after ſtrange gods. The principal and moſt powerful Tribes, to wit, <hi>Reuben, Ephraim, Benjamin, Dan, Aſher,</hi> and ſome others adhered wholly to <hi>Iabin.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding the Propheteſs <hi>Debora</hi> which judged <hi>Iſrael,</hi> cauſed the Tribes of <hi>Zebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Nephthalie,</hi> and <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> or at the leſt ſome of all thoſe Tribes, to take arms under the conduct of <hi>Barac,</hi> and they overthrew <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera</hi> the Lieftenant of <hi>Iabin,</hi> and delivered <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which had no thought of liberty, and was content to remain in bondage; and having ſhaken off the yoke of <hi>Canaaniets</hi> they re-eſtabliſhed the pure ſervice of the living God. But for ſo much as <hi>Debora</hi> ſeems to have an extraordinary vocation, and that the Scripture doth not approve in expreſſe terms the doings of them of <hi>Libna,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that in not diſallowing of their proceedings, it may ſeem
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:124812:19"/> in ſome ſort to allow them, and for that the Hiſtory of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees</hi> hath had no great authoritie in the ancient Church and for that it is comonly held that an aſſertion muſt be proved by laws and teſtimonies, not by examples, let us examine by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what we ought to judge according to the right of the matter now in queſtion. We have formerly ſaid that the King did ſwear to keep the Law of God, and promiſe to the uttermoſt of his power to maintain the Church: that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> conſidered in one body covenanting by the High-Prieſt, made the ſame promiſe to God. Now at this preſent we ſay, that all the Towns, and all the Magiſtrates of theſe Towns which be parts and portions of the Kingdom, promiſe each of them in his own behalf, and in expreſs terms the which all Towns and Chriſtian Communalties have alſo done, although it have been but with a tacite conſent. <hi>Ioſhua</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ioſuah <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Joſhuah</hi> for his part having paſſed this contract of agreement between God and the people and inregiſtred the whole according as it was done, for a perpetual memorial of the matter he incontinently ſet up a ſtone.</p>

And to the end it be not ſuppoſed, that ſome alteration hath been inſerted after the creation of Kings: In the times of <hi>Joas</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> when there was queſtion of renewing the Covenant between God and the People, all the Eſtates met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all were bound and obliged particularly.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:124812:20"/> but alſo all the Paſtors of the Kingdom promiſe each of them for their ſelves, fidelity and obedience to God. I ſay again, that not only the King and the People, but alſo all the Towns of Iſrael, and their Magiſtrates, oblige themſelves to God, and as homagers to their liege lord tie themſelves to be his for ever, with and againſt all men, for further proof of the aforeſaid, I would entreat the Reader to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently turn over the holy Bible, eſpecially in the books of the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Chronicles.</hi> But for a yet more ample explication of this matter, let us produce for example what is in practiſe at this day. In the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> when the Emperor is to be crowned, the Electors and Princes of the Empire, as well Secular as Eccleſiaſtical, meet together perſonally, or elſe ſend their Ambaſſadors. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, Earls, and Barons, and all the Deputies of the Imperial Towns, come thither alſo, or elſe ſend ſpecial Proxies; then do they their homage to the Emperor; either for themſelves, or for them whom they repreſent, with and under certain conditions: Now let us preſuppoſe that one of theſe which hath done homage volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, do afterwards endevour to depoſe the Emperor, and advance himſelf into his place, and that the Princes and Barons deny their Soveraign the ſuccors and tribute which they owe him, and that they have intelligence with that other which conſpired and ſought to poſſeſs himſelf of the Imperial Throne: Think you that they of <hi>Straesborgh</hi> or of <hi>Nurembergh,</hi> which have bound themſelves by faith unto the lawful Emperor, have not lawful right to repreſs and exclude this trayterous Intruder?

So then, as if a Vice-Roy conſpiring againſt his Soveraign, although he had received from him an unlimitted authority, if he ſhould ſummon us to deliver the King whom he held beſieged within the incloſure of our walls, we ought not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, but reſiſt with the uttermoſt of our power and means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of our oath of Allegiance: In like manner think we that it is not a wickednes of all moſt deteſtable, if at the pleaſure of a Prince which is the vaſſal and ſervant of God, we ſhould drive God from dwelling amongſt us, or deliver him (as far as in us <note place="margin">10 <hi>Collat de forma Fidei, &amp;c. 1. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And I anſwer, that the Towns conſiſt not of a heap of ſtones, but of that which we call people, that the people is the people of God, to whom they are firſt bound by oath: and ſecondly, to the King. For the Towns, although that the Kings have power over them, notwithſtanding the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Soyl belongs to the Citizens and Owners, for all that which is in a Kingdom, is indeed under the Dominion of the King, but not of his proper Patrimony: God in truth is the onely Lord propriator of all things, and it is of him that the King holds <note place="margin">Senec. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>de Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nef.</hi> c. 6, 7. &amp;c.</note>

This is as much as to ſay, you will reply, that for the cauſe of Religion it ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the ſubjects to revolt from the obedience of their King, if this be once granted, it will preſently open a gap to rebellion? But hearken I pray you patiently, and conſider this matter more throughly: I might anſwer in a word, that of two things, if the one muſt needs be done, it were much better to forſake the King, then God; or with S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his fourth book of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God, chap. 4. and in the nineteenth book, and chapter the 21. That where there is no Juſtice, there is no Common-wealth. That there is no Juſtice, when he that is a mortal man would pull an other man out of the hands of the immortal God, to make him a ſlave of the devil, ſeing that Juſtice is a vertue that gives to every one that which is his own, and that thoſe which draw their necks out of the yoke of ſuch Rulers, deliver themſelves from the Tyrannie of wicked ſpirits, and abandon a multitude of robbers, and not the Common-wealth. But to re-aſſume this diſcourſe a little higher, thoſe which ſhall carry themſelves as hath been formerly ſaid, ſeem no waies accuſable of the crime of revolt. Thoſe are ſaid proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to quit the King or the Common-wealth, which with the heart and purpoſe of an Enemy withdraw themſelves from the obedience of the King or the Commonwealth, by means whereof they are juſtly accounted adverſaries, and are oftentimes much more to be feared then any other enemies. But thoſe of whom we now ſpeak, do nothing reſemble them. Firſt they do in no ſort refuſe to obey, provided that they be commanded that which they may lawfully <note place="margin">L 5. D. de cap. minut.</note> do, and that it be not againſt the honour of God. They pay wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly the Taxes, Cuſtoms, Impoſts, and ordinary payments, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that with theſe they ſeek not to aboliſh the tribute which they ow unto God. They obey <hi>Caeſar</hi> while he commands in the quality of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> but when <hi>Caeſar</hi> paſſeth his bounds, when he uſurps that Dominion which is none of his own, when he endeavours to aſſail the Throne of God, when he wars againſt the ſoveraign Lord both of himſelf and the people; they then eſteem it reaſonable not to obey <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and yet after this to ſpeak properly, they do no acts of hoſtility. He is properly an enemie which ſtirs up, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes another, which out of military inſolencie prepareth and ſeteth forth parties to war. They have been urged and aſſailed by open war, and cloſe and trecherous ſurpriſalls: when death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on environs them round about, then they take armes, and wade

               <p>Be it known to the great fooliſhneſſe and unbounded raſhneſſe, that in temporall matters we have only God for our ſuperiour, and that the vacancy of certain Churches, and pretends belongs to us by copall prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and that it appertaines to us onely to gather the fruites, and wee will defend the poſſeſſion thereof againſt all oppoſers, with the edge of our Swords, accounting them fooles, and without braynes that hold a contrary opinion. In thoſe times all men acknowledged the Pope for Gods Vicar on earth, and head of the univerſal Church: Inſomuch, that (as it is ſaid) common errour went inſtead of a Law, notwithſtanding the Sorboniſts being aſſembled, and demanded, made anſwer, that the <note place="margin">L. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Philip D. de Senat.</hi>

               <p>In the year of our Lord 2408. when Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the 13. did oppoſe the <hi>French</hi> Church by tributes, and exactions, the Clergy aſſembled; by the Command of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 6. decreed: that the King and Inhabitants <note place="margin">Annales of France monſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</note> of the Kingdom, ought not to obey <hi>Benedict,</hi> which was an Heritick, a ſchiſmatick, and altogether unworthy of that dignity: the which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Kingdom approved, and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> confirmed by a decree. The ſame Clergy alſo ordained that thoſe which had been excommunicated by that Pope: as forſakers and enemies of the Church, ſhould be preſently abſolved, nullifying all ſuch excommunications, and this hath been practiſed not in <hi>France</hi> onely, but in other places alſo: as Hiſtories do credibly report.

I anſwer, that if they be conſidered in themſelves, they may well be accounted particuler perſons, inſomuch as they had not any ordinary vocation; But, ſeeing that we know that they were called extraordinarily, and that God himſelfe hath (if we may ſo ſpeak) put his ſword into their hands, be it far from us to account them particuler or private perſons, but rather let us eſteeme them by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, excelling any ordinary Magiſtrates whatſoever. The calling of <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:124812:24"/> is approved by the expreſſe word of God, and by moſt evident miracles, it is ſaid of <hi>Ehud,</hi> that God ſtirred him up to kill the Tyrant, and deliver <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for <hi>Iehu,</hi> he was anointed by the Commandement of the Prophet <hi>Elizeus,</hi> for to roote out the race of <hi>Ahab,</hi> beſides, that the principall men ſaluted him King, before he executed any thing. There may as much be ſaid of all the reſt, whoſe examples are propounded in holy writ. But where God Almighty doth not ſpeak with his own mouth, nor extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily by his Prophets, it is there that we ought to be exceeding cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and to ſtand upon our guards; for if any ſuppoſing he is inſpired by the Holy-Ghoſt, do attribute to himſelfe the before mentioned authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I would intreat him to looke that he be not puffed up with vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and leaſt he make not a God to himſelfe of his own fancy, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to his own inventions, let him not then be conceived with vanity, leaſt inſtead of fruite he bring forth deluding lies. Let the people alſo be adviſed on their parts, leaſt in deſiring to fight under the Banner of Jeſus Chriſt, they run not to their own confuſion to follow the Army of ſome Gallilean Thendas, or of <hi>Barcezha:</hi> as it happened to the Peſants and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts of <hi>Munſter,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the year 1323.

But I would willingly demand of ſuch exceptioniſts: whether they think that by the coming of Jeſus Chriſt in the fleſh, that Magiſtrates have loſt their right in the ſword of Authority?

Now if to bear arms &amp; to make war be a thing lawfull, can there poſſibly be found any war more juſt, then that which is taken in hand by the command of the ſuperiour, for the defence of the Church, and the preſervation of the faithfull?

Notwithſtanding, ſince that we ſee that the Kings have not reigned, before the people had ordained and inſtalled them, with requiſite Ceremonies: it may be collected from this, that the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was hereditary, if we conſider <hi>David</hi> and the promiſe made to him, and that it was wholly elective, if we regard the particuler perſons. But to what purpoſe is this, but to make it apparent, that the election is onely mentioned, that the Kings might have alwayes in their remembrance, that they were raiſed to their dignities by the people, and therefore they ſhould never forget during life, in what a ſtrict bond of obſervance they are tyed to thoſe from whom they have received all their greatneſſe. We read that the Kings of the Heathen have been eſtabliſhed alſo by the people; for as when they had either troubles at home, or warres abroad, ſome one in whoſe ready vallour, and diſcreete integrity, the people did principally relye and repoſe their greateſt <note place="margin">

The ſame alſo did <hi>Tiberius, Caligula</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> and the firſt that aſſumed the Empire to himſelf without any colour of right, was <hi>Nero</hi> who alſo by the ſenate was condemned. Briefly for ſo much as none were ever

                  <p>Therefore, as all the whole People is above the King, and likewiſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in one entire body are in authority before him; yet being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one by one they are all of them under the King. It is eaſie to know how far the power of the firſt Kings extended, in that <hi>Ephron</hi> King of the <hi>Hittites</hi> could not grant <hi>Abraham</hi> the Sepulchre, but in the preſence and with the conſent of the People: neither could <hi>Hemor</hi> the <hi>Hevite</hi>

This might eaſily be practiſed in thoſe kingdomes, which were then almoſt confined within the circuit of one towne.</p>
                  <p>But ſince that Kings began to extend their limits, and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the People to aſſemble together all into one place becauſe of their great numbers, which would have occaſioned confuſion the Officers of the kingdome were eſtabliſhed, which ſhould ordinarily preſerve the rights of the People, in ſuch ſort notwithſtanding, as when extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion required the People might be aſſembled, or at the leaſt ſuch an abridgement as might by the principalleſt Members be a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the whole Body. We ſee this order eſtabliſhed in the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which (in the judgment of the wiſeſt Politicians) was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ordered.

                  <p>Furthermore, the kingdome had in every town Magiſtrates, which had the particular government of them, as the former were for the whole kingdome. At ſuch times as affairs of conſequence were to be treated of, they aſſembled together, but nothing that concerned the publike ſtate could receive any ſolid determination. <hi>David</hi> aſſembled the Officers of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 1 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 1.</note> his kingdome when he deſired to inveſt his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> with the Royal Dignity; when he would have examined and approved that manner of policy, and managing of affairs, that he had revived and reſtored, and when there was queſtion of removing the Ark of the Covenant.</p>

Now all theſe officers take their oath to the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, to the people in the firſt place, then to the <hi>King</hi> which is protector of he <hi>Kingdome,</hi> the which appears by the tenour of the oath. Above all, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:124812:33"/> Conſtable, who receiving the Sword from the King, hath it girded unto him with this charge, <hi>That he maintain and defend the Common-wealth,</hi> as appears by the words that the King then pronounceth.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the kingdome of <hi>France</hi> hath the Peers (ſo called either for <note place="margin">S. <hi>Filius fam. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. quib. mod. jus patriae pot. ſolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>

                  <p>We may alſo know, that thoſe Peers of <hi>France</hi> did often diſcuſſe ſuits and differences between the King and his Subjects: Inſomuch, that when <hi>Charles</hi> the 6. would have given ſentence againſt the Duke of <hi>Brittain</hi> they oppoſed it, alleadging that the diſcuſſing of that buſineſſe belonged properly to the Peers, and not to the king, who might not in any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Therefore it is, that yet at this day the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> is called the Court of Peers, being in ſome ſort conſtituted Judge between the king and the people; yea, between the king and every private perſon, and is bound and ought to maintain the meaneſt in the kingdome againſt the kings Attorney, if he undertake any thing contrary to law.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, if the king ordain any thing in his Councell, if he treat any agreement with the Princes his neighbours, if he begin a Warre, or make peace, as lately with <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. the Emperour, the Parliament ought to interpoſe their authority, and all that which concerns the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like State muſt be there inregiſtred; neither is there any thing firm and ſtable which the Parliament doth not firſt approve. And to the end, that the Councellours of that Parliament ſhould not fear the king, formerly they attained not to that place, but by the nomination of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Court; neither could they be diſmiſſed for any lawfull cauſe, but by the authority of the ſaid Body.</p>

The outragiouſneſſe of Kings, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the party, together with the wicked connivence of the great ones of the kingdome, hath been for the moſt part ſuch throughout the World, that the licentious and unbridled power wherewith moſt kings are tranſported and which hath made them inſupportable, hath in a manner by the length of continuance gained right of preſcription, and the people for want of uſing it hath incitely quit, if not altogether loſt their juſt &amp; ancient authority. So that it ordinarily happens, that what all mens care ought to attend on, is for the moſt part neglected by every man; for what is commited to the generalty, no man thinkes is commended to his cuſtody.

                  <p>Now ſeeing that Kings have been ever eſtabliſhed by the people, and that they have had Aſſociates joyned with them to contain them within the limits of their duties, the which Aſſociates conſidered in particular one by one, are under the King and altogether in one intire Body are above him.

                  <p>In the firſt place every one conſents, <hi>That men by nature loving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and having ſervitude, born rather to command, then obey, have not willingly admitted to be governed by another, and renounced as it were the priviledge of nature, by ſubmitting themſelves to the commands of others;</hi>

                  <p>Let us then conclude, that they are eſtabliſhed in this place to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by juſtice, and to defend by force of Armes, both the publike State and perticular perſons from all dammages and outrages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thoſe are properly called Lords and Maſters</hi>

                  <p>Therefore, then to govern is nothing elſe but to provide for. Theſe proper ends of commanding, being far the Peoples commodity; the only duty of Kings and Emperours is to provide for the peoples good, The Kingly dignity to ſpeak properly is not a Title of Honour, but a

                  <p>This may be proved by all Hiſtories, both divine and prophane For the people of God they had at firſt no other King but God himſelfe, who dwelt in the middeſt of them, and gave anſwer from betweene the Cherubins, appointed extraordinarily Judges and Captaines for the wars, by meanes whereof, the people thought they had no need of Lieutenants, being honoured by the continuall preſence of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign King.</p>

                  <p>It being then ſo that every one loves that which is his owne, yea that many covet that which belongs to other men, is it any thing probable that men ſhould ſeek a maſter to give him franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie al that they had long laboured for, and gained with the ſweat of their browes? may we not rather imagine, that they choſe ſuch a man on whoſe integrity they relied for the adminiſtring of juſtice equally both to the poore and rich, and which would not aſſume all to himſelfe, but rather maintaine every one in the fruition of his own goods? or who like an unprofitable Drone ſhould ſuck the fruit of other mens labours, but rather preſerve the houſe, for thoſe whoſe induſtrie juſtly deſerved it? briefly, who inſtead of extorting from the true owners their goods, would ſee them defended from all ravening oppreſſors? What I pray you skills it ſayes the poore Countrie man, whether the King, or the enemy make havok of my goods, ſince through the ſpoile thereof I and my poore familie die for hunger? what imports it whether a ſtranger or home-bred caterpiller ruine my eſtate, and bring my poore fortune to extream beggery? Whether a forrein Souldier, or a Sicophant Courtier by force or fraud, make me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like miſerable? Why ſhall he be accounted a barbarous enemy, if thou be a friendly Patriot? Why he a Tyrant if thou be a King? Yea certainly by how much parracide is greater then manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by ſo much the wickedneſſe of a King, exceeds in miſchiefe the violence of an enemy.</p>
                  <p>If then therefore in the creation of Kings, men gave not their own proper goods unto them, but onely recommended them to their protection; by what other right then, but that of free booters, can they challenge the propertie of other mens goods to themſelves? Wherefore the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were not (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law) at the firſt the Lords of particular mens eſtates, but were onely then when they were ſold unto them for corne, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:124812:46"/> yet may there well be queſtion made of the validitie of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not compell <hi>Naboth</hi> to ſell him his <note place="margin">Gen 45. 1 Kings. 21. 1. &amp;c.</note> vineyard; but rather if he had been willing, the Law of God would not permit it. The Roman Emperors which had an unreaſonable power, could neither by right have done it. At this day there is with much difficultie any Kingdom to be found, where the meaneſt Subject may not ſue the King, &amp; where many times the <note place="margin">L. venditor. 13.

And to this is not contrarie, although at the firſt veiw it ſeeme ſo, that which ſome of their moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars have written of the Emperors. That by the civill Law all things were the Kings, and that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was abſolute Lord of all <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Seneca lib. de benef. 7.

                  <p>In like manner in the Empire of <hi>Germanie,</hi> the revenue of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> is one thing, and the revenue of the Emperor <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> is another: the Empire, and the Emperor have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall treaſurers: as alſo there is difference in the inheritances which the Princes derive from the houſes of their anceſtors, and thoſe which are annexed to the Electorall dignities. Yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves, <hi>Selimus</hi> his gardens and patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall lands are diſtinſtuiſhed from thoſe of the publick, the one ſerving for the proviſion of the <hi>Sultans</hi> table, the other imploied onely about the <hi>Turquiſh</hi> affaires of State.

                  <p>To conclude we muſt needs reſolve, that Kings are neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, nor uſu-fructuaries of the royall patrimony: but only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators: and being ſo, they can by no juſt right attribute to themſelves the propriety, uſe or profit of private mens eſtates, nor with as little reaſon the publique revennues, which are in truth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Common-wealths.</p>
                  <p>But before we paſſe any further, we muſt here reſolve a doubt. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> having demanded a King, the Lords ſaid to <hi>Samuel:</hi> hearken unto the voice of the people: notwithſtanding, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 7. &amp;c.</note> give them to underſtand what ſhall be the manner of the King which ſhall reigne over them: <hi>he will take your fields, your vineyards, your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-trees, to furniſh his owne occaſions, and to enrich his ſervants:</hi> briefly, <hi>he will make the people ſlaves.</hi> One would hardly believe in what eſtimation the Courtiers of our times hold this Text, when of all the reſt of the holy Scripture they make but a jeſt. In this place the Almighty and all good God, would manifeſt to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> their Levite, when that they had God himſelfe even preſent with them, who upon all occaſions appointed them holy Judges, and worthy Commanders for the Wars, would notwithſtanding rather ſubject themſelves to the diſordered commandements of a vaine mutable man, than to the ſecure protection of the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and immutable God. Hee declares then unto them in what a ſlippery eſtate the King was placed, and how eaſily unruly authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fell into diſordered violence, and Kingly power was turned into tyrannous wilfulneſſe. Seeing the King that he gave them, would by prepoſterous violence draw the ſword of authority againſt them, and ſubject the equity of the lawes to his owne unjuſt deſires: and this miſchief which they wilfully drew on themſelves; they would happily repent of, when it would not be ſo eaſily remedied. Briefly, this Text doth not deſcribe the right of Kings, but what right they are accuſtomed to attribute to themſelves: not what by the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their places they may juſtly doe: but what power for the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:124812:52"/> ſatisfying of their owne luſts, they unjuſtly uſurp. This will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeare from the 17. Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a law for Kings. Here ſaies <hi>Samuel</hi> the <hi>King will uſe his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects like ſlaves:</hi> there God forbids the King <hi>to lift his heart above his brethren:</hi> to wit, <hi>over his Subjects, whom he ought not to inſult over, but to cheriſh as his kinſmen. Hee will make Chariots, leavy horſe-men, and take the goods of private men,</hi> ſaies <hi>Samuel:</hi> on the contrary in <hi>Deutronomy,</hi> he is exhorted <hi>not to multiply horſe-men, nor to heape up</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>gold and ſilver, nor cauſe the people to returne into Aegypt,</hi> to wit, <hi>into bondage.</hi> In <hi>Samuel</hi> we ſee pictured to the life wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> which <note place="margin">1 Kings 21.</note> by pernitious meanes gets <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard: there <hi>David,</hi> who held it not lawfull to drinke that water which was purchaſed with <note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 16.</note> the danger of his Subjects lives. <hi>Samuel</hi> fortels that the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in ſtead of keeping the lawes, would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne all according to his own fancie: on the contrary, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that his Law ſhould by the Prieſts be delivered into the hands of the King, to copie it out, and to have it continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes. Therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> being high Prieſt, gave to <hi>Saul</hi> the royall law contained in the 17. of <hi>Deutronomy,</hi> written into a book, which certainly had been a frivolous act if the King were permitted to break it at his pleaſure. Briefly, it is as much as if <hi>Samuel</hi> had ſaid. <hi>You have asked a King after the manner of other Nations, the moſt of whom have Tyrants for their Governours:</hi> You deſire a King to diſtribute juſtice equally amongſt you: but many of them think all things lawfull which their owne appetites ſuggeſts unto them; in the meane ſeaſon you willingly ſhake off the Lord, whoſe only will is equity and juſtice in the abſtract.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Heroditus</hi> there is a hiſtory which plainly expreſſes, <hi>bow apt the royall governement is to degenerate into tyranny,</hi> whereof <hi>Samuel</hi> ſo <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Herod. l.</hi> 2.</note> exactly forewarns the people. <hi>Deioces</hi> much renowned for his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, was firſt choſen Judge amongſt the <hi>Medes:</hi> preſently after, to the end hee might the better repreſſe thoſe which would oppoſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he was choſen King, and inveſted with convenient authority, then he deſired a guard, after a Citadell to be built in <hi>Eebatana</hi> the principall Citie of the Kingdome, with colour to ſecure him from conſpiracies and machinations of Rebels; which being effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, he preſently applies himſelfe to revenge the leaſt diſpleaſures which were offered him with the greateſt puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>Finally, no man might preſume to looke this King in the face,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:124812:53"/> and to laugh or cough in his preſence, was puniſhed with grievous torments. So dangerous a thing it is, to put into the hands of a weake mind (as all mens are by nature) unlimited power. <hi>Samuel</hi> therefore teacheth not in that place, that the authority of a King is abſolute: on the contrary hee diſcreetly admoniſheth the people not to enthrall their liberty under the unneceſſary yoake of a weak and unruly Maſter: he doth not abſolutely exclude the royall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but would have it reſtrain'd within its own limits: he doth not amplifie the Kings right with an unbridled and licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: but rather tacitely perſwades to put a bit into his mouth. It ſeemes that this advice of <hi>Samuels</hi> was very beneficiall to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> for that they circumſpectly moderated the power of their Kings, the which moſt Nations growne wiſe, either by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their own, or their neighbours harmes, have carefully loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked unto, as will plainly appear by that which follows.</p>
                  <p>We have ſhewed already, that in the eſtabliſhing of the King, <note place="margin">An alliance or covenant between the K. &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Deut. 17. 1 Sam. 10. 27. 2 Sam. 5. 3.</note> there were two alliances or convenants contracted: the firſt between God, the King, and the people, of which wee have formerly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the ſecond between the King and the people, of which wee muſt now ſay ſome-what. After that <hi>Saul</hi> was eſtabliſhed King, the royall Law was givne him, according to which he ought to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne. <hi>David made a Covenant in Hebron before the Lord,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>taking God for witneſſe, with all the ancients of Iſrael, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the whole bodie of the people, &amp; even then he was made King. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Chron. 11. 3.</note> alſo by the mouth of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High Prieſt, entered into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>with the whole people of the land in the houſe of the Lord:</hi> And <note place="margin">2 King. 11. 17. &amp; 12. 2 Chron. 23. 3.</note> when the Crowne was ſet on his head, together with it was the law of the Teſtimony put into his hand, which moſt expounds to be the law of God: likewiſe <hi>Joſias</hi> promiſeth <hi>to obſerve and keepe the Commandements, Teſtimonies and Statutes comprized in the booke of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 King. 23. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>the Covenant:</hi> under which words are contained all which belongs to the duties both of the firſt and ſecond Table of the law of God. In all the before remembred places of the holy ſtory, it is ever ſaid <hi>that a Covenant was made with all the people, with all the multitude, with all the Elders, with all the men of Juda:</hi> to the end that we might know, as it is alſo fully expreſſed, that not only the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals of the Tribes, but alſo all the Milleniers, Centurions, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterne Magiſtrates ſhould meete together, each of them in the name, and for their Townes and Communalties, to covenant and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:124812:53"/> contract with the King. In this aſſembly was the creating of the King determined of: for it was the people that made the King, and not the King the people.</p>
                  <p>It is certain then, that the people by way of ſtipulation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a performance of covenants, the King promiſes it. Now the condition of a Stipulator is in termes of law more worthy than of a promiſer. The people asketh the King, whether he will govern juſtly and according to the lawes? He promiſeth he will. Then the people anſwereth, and not before, that whileſt he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes uprightly, they will obey faithfully. The King therefore promiſeth ſimply and abſolutely, the people upon condition: the which failing to be accompliſhed, the people reſt according to equity and reaſon, quit from their promiſe.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt covenant, or contract, there is onely an obligation to piety: in the ſecond, to juſtice. In that the King promiſeth to ſerve God religiouſly: in this, to rule the people juſtly. By the one he is obliged with the utmoſt of his endeavours to procure the glory of God: by the other, the profit of the people. In the firſt there is a condition expreſſed, If thou keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: in the ſecond, If thou diſtribute juſtice equally to every man. God is the proper revenger of deficiency in the former, and the whole people the lawfull puniſher of delinquency in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the Eſtates, the repreſentative body thereof, who have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to themſelves the protection of the people. This hath been alwayes practiſed in all well-governed Eſtates. Amongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> after the due performance of holy Rites, they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with <hi>Cyrus</hi> in manner following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou, O Cyrus, in the firſt place, ſhalt promiſe, That if any make war</hi>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:124812:54"/> to govern according to the Lawes, ſo did the <hi>Ephores</hi> alſo to maintain them in their authority, whileſt they performed their promiſe. Likewiſe in the <hi>Romane</hi> Kingdome there was an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between <hi>Romulus</hi> the Senate, and the people, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>That the people ſhould make Lawes, and the King looke they were kept: The people ſhould decree warre, and the King ſhould manage it.</hi> Now although many Emperours rather by force and ambition, than by any lawfull right, were ſeaſ'd of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and by that which they call a Royall Law, attributed to themſelves an abſolute authority; notwithſtanding by the fragments which remain both in books, and in <hi>Roman</hi> Inſcriptions, of that Law, it plainly appeares, that power and authority was granted them to preſerve and govern the Common-wealth, not to ruine and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it by tyranny. Nay, all good Emperours have ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that they held themſelves tied to the Laws, &amp; received the Empire from the Senate, to whoſe determination they alwayes referred the moſt important affairs, and eſteemed it a great error without their advice to reſolve on the occaſions of the publick State.</p>
                  <p>If we take into our conſideration the condition of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, Kingdomes and States of times, there is not any of them worthy of thoſe names, where there is not ſome ſuch covenant or confederacy between the people and the Prince. It is not long ſince that in the Empire of Germany, the King of the <hi>Romanes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to be crowned Emperour; was bound to doe homage, and make oath of Fealty to the Empire, no more nor leſſe than as the vaſſall is bound to doe to his Lord when he is inveſted with his fec. Although the form of the words which he is to ſweare, have been ſomewhat altered by the Popes, yet notwithſtanding the ſubſtance ſtill remains the ſame.

Whereupon it followes, that the Emperour is tied abſoutely, and the princes of the Empire, under condition. That the ſame is obſerved in the Kingdome of <hi>Polonia,</hi> no man will make queſtion, who had but ſeen or heard of the ceremonies and rites wherewith <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Anjoy</hi> was lately choſen and crowned King of that Countrey, &amp; eſpecially then when the condition of maintaining of the two Religions, the Reformed and the <hi>Roman,</hi> was demanded, the which the Lords of the kingdome in expreſſe termes required of him three ſeverall times, and he as often made promiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.

This is ſtraitly obſerved in the Cities of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and <hi>Rochel,</hi> and in the Countries of <hi>Daulphinie, Province,</hi> and <hi>Britaine:</hi> The which Townes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces have their particular and expreſſe Covenants and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the Kings, which muſt needs be voyde, if the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expreſſed in the Contract be not of force, nor the Kings tied to the performance.</p>
                  <p>There is the forme of the Oath of the ancient Kings of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In Annal. Burgund.</note> yet extant in theſe words: <hi>I will protect all men in their rights, according to Law and juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>England, Scotland, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi> there is almoſt the ſame cuſtome as in <hi>France:</hi> but in no place there is uſed a more diſcreet care in their manner of proceeding, than in <hi>Spaine.</hi> For in the Kingdome of <hi>Arragon,</hi> after the finiſhing of many Ceremonies, which are uſed between him, which repreſents the <hi>Juſtitia major</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> which comprehends the majeſtie of the Common-wealth, ſeated in a higher ſeate, and the King, which is to be crowned, who ſweares fealtie, and does his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: and having reade the Lawes and conditions, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment whereof he is ſworne.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the Lords of the Kingdome uſe to the King theſe words in the vulgar Language, as is before expreſſed, <hi>page</hi> 60. <note place="margin">Nos qui vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos tanto co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo vos, y po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demos mas que vos, vos elegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos kei con e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas è y eſtat conditiones, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra vos y nos un que manda mas que vos.</note> 
                     <hi>Wee which are as much worth as you, and have more power than you, chooſe you King upon theſe and theſe conditions, and there is one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                  <p>And if under pretext of his royall dignitie he become inſolent, violating the Lawes, and neglect his publick faith and promiſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then by the priviledge of the Kingdome, he is judged, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, as execrable as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtata was by the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church: which excommunication is eſteemed of that validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that inſtead of praying for the King in their publick orayſons, they pray againſt him, and the ſubjects are by the ſame right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit from their oath of Alleageance: as the vaſſall is exempted from obedience and obligation by oath to his Lord which ſtands excommunicated; the which hath been determined and confirmed <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner, in the Kingdome of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in full aſſembly of the Eſtates, the King being readie to be crowned, is firſt in the preſence of all advertiſed of his dutie: and even then are reade the Articles diſcreetly compoſed for the good of the Common-wealth, the King ſweares he will obſerve and keepe them carefully and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; which being done, then the Conſtable takes his oath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance, after the Princes and Deputies for the Townes ſweare each of them in their order; and the ſame is obſerved in the Kingdomes of <hi>Portugall, Leon,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Spaine.</hi> The leſſer principallities have their inſtitution grounded on the ſame right. The contracts which the <hi>Brabancers</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Netherland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> together with thoſe of <hi>Auſtria, Carinthia,</hi> and others, had with <note place="margin">La Joyeuſe entreè.</note> their Princes, were alwayes conditionall. But eſpecially the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancers,</hi> to take away all occaſion of diſpute, have this expreſſe condition: which is that in the receiving of their Duke, there is read in his preſence the ancient Articles, wherein is comprized that which is requiſite for the publick good; and thereunto is alſo added, that if he doe not exactly and preciſely obſerve them, they may chooſe what other Lord it ſhall ſeeme good unto them; the which they doe in expreſſe words proteſt unto him. He having allowed and accepted of theſe Articles, doth in that publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie promiſe and ſolemnly ſweare to keepe them. The which was
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:124812:56"/> obſerved in the reception of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ludovicus Guicciard. in Diſcript. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae.</note> Briefly, there is not any man can denie, but that there is a contract mutually obligatorie between the King and the Subjects, which requires the people to obey faithfully, and the King to governe lawfully, for the performance whereof the King ſweares firſt, and after the people.</p>
                  <p>I would aske here wherefore a man doth ſweare, if it be not to declare, that what he delivers he ſincerely intends from his heart? Can any thing be judged more neere to the law of nature, than to obſerve that which we approve? Furthermore, what is the reaſon <note place="margin">L. 1. D. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact. l. non minorum 20. D. de tranſact</note> the King ſweares firſt, and at the inſtance, and required by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but to accept a condition either tacite or expreſſed? Wherefore is there a condition oppoſed to the Contract, if it be not that in fayling to performe the condition, the contract according to law remaines voyde? And if for want of ſatisfying the condition by right, the contract is of no force: who ſhall dare to call that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple perjured, which refuſeth to obey a King which makes no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his promiſe, which he might and ought to have kept, and wilfully breakes thoſe lawes which he did ſweare to obſerve? On the contrary, may we not rather eſteeme ſuch a King perfidious, perjured, and unworthy of his place? For if the Law free the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall <note place="margin">Lib. 2. feudor. tit. 26. §. 24. &amp; tit. 47. Dionyſ. Halic. lib. 2.</note> from his Lord, who dealt felloniouſly with him, although that to ſpeake properly the Lord ſweareth not fealtie to his vaſſall, but he to him: if the Law of the twelve Tables doth deteſt and hold in execration the protector that defraudeth him that is under his tuition: if the civill Law permit an infranchiſed ſervant to bring his action againſt his patron, for any grievous uſage: if in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſame Law delivers the ſlave from the power of his Maſter, although the obligation be naturall onely and not civill: is it not much more reaſonable that the people be looſed from that oath of alleageance which they have taken, if the King (who may be not unfitly reſembled by an Atturney ſworne to looke to his Clients cauſe) firſt breake his oath ſolemnly taken? And what if all theſe ceremonies, ſolemne oaths, nay ſacramentall promiſes had never been taken? Doth not nature her ſelfe ſufficiently teach that Kings were on this condition ordained by the people, that they ſhould governe well? Judges that they ſhould diſtribute juſtice uprightly? Captaines in the warre, that they ſhould lead their Armes againſt their enemies: If on the contrary, they themſelves forrage and ſpoile
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:124812:56"/> their ſubjects, and inſtead of governors become enemies, as they leave indeed the true and eſſentiall qualities of a King, ſo neither ought the people to acknowledge them for lawfull Princes. But what if a people (you will reply) ſubdued by force, be compeld <note place="margin">Cicer. 1. Offic.</note> by the King to take an oath of ſervitude? And what if a robber, pirate, or tyrant, (I will anſwer) with whom no bond of humane ſocietie can be effectuall, holding his dagger to your throate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine you preſently to become bound in a great ſum of money? Is it not an unqueſtionable Maxime in Law, that a promiſe exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by violence cannot binde? eſpecially if any thing be promiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt common reaſon, or the law of nature? Is there any thing more repugnant to nature and reaſon, than that a people ſhould manicle and fetter themſelves; and to be obliged by promiſe to the Prince, with their own hands and weapons to be their own execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners? There is therefore a mutuall obligation between the King and the people, which whether it be civill or naturall onely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tacite, or expreſſed in words, it cannot by any meanes be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, nor by any Law be abrogated, much leſſe by force made voyde. And this obligation is of ſuch power, that the Prince which wilfully violates it, is a tyrant: and the people which purpoſely breakes it, may be juſtly termed ſeditious.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have treated of a King, it now reſts wee doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more fully deſcribe a Tyrant. Wee have ſhewed that he is a <note place="margin">Who may truly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tyrants?</note> King, which lawfully governes a Kingdome, either derived to him by ſucceſſion, or committed to him by Election. It followes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he is reputed a tyrant, which as oppoſite to a King, either <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ariſto. lib. 5. polit. c.</hi> 10.</note> gaines a kingdome by violence, or indirect meanes, or being inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted therewith by lawfull election or ſucceſſion, governes it not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law and equitie, or neglects thoſe contracts and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">Bartol. in tract. de ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannide.</note> to the obſervation whereof he was ſtrictly oblieged at his reception. All which may very well occurre in one and the ſame perſon. The firſt is commonly called a tyrant without title: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a tyrant by practiſe. Now it may well ſo come to paſſe, that he which poſſeſſeth himſelfe of a kingdome by force, to governe juſtly, and he on whom it deſcends by a lawfull title, to rule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly. But for ſo much as a kingdome is rather a right than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and an office than a poſſeſſion: he ſeemes rather worthy the name of a tyrant, which unworthily acquits himſelfe of his charge, than he which entered into his place by a wrong dore.

                  <p>Briefely, the Tyrant by practiſe vainely colouring his unjuſt extortions with the juſtice of his title, is much more blameable then the Tyrant without title, who recompenceth the violence of his firſt intruſion in a continued courſe of a legall and upright government.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, there may be obſerved ſome difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <note place="margin">Tyrants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out title.</note> Tyrants without title: For there are ſome which am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly invade their neighbours Countreyes, to enlarge their owne, as <hi>Nimrod, Minus,</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites</hi> have done. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch are term'd Kings by their owne people, yet to thoſe on whoſe confines they have encroached without any juſt right, or occaſion, they will be accounted Tyrants.</p>
                  <p>There be others which having attained to the government of an elective Kingdome, that endeavour by deceitfull meanes, by corruption, by preſent, and other bad practiſes, to make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hereditary.

                  </p>
                  <p>There be alſo others which are ſo horribly wicked, that they ſeeke to enthrall their own native Countrey like the viperous brood which goaw through the entralls of their mother: as be thoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of Armies created by the people, who afterwards by the meanes of thoſe forces make themſelves maſters of the State, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> under pretence of the Dictatorſhip, and divers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <p>There be women alſo which intrude themſelves into the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe kingdoms which the lawes only permit to the males, and make themſelves Queenes and Regents, as <hi>Athalia</hi> did in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab, Semiramis</hi> in <hi>Aſſyria, Agripina</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the Reign of her ſonne <hi>Nero, Mammea</hi> in <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> his time, <hi>Semiamira</hi> in <hi>Heliogabaluſſes;</hi> and certaine <hi>Brunichildes</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France,</hi> who ſo educated their ſonnes [as the Queens of the houſe <hi>Medicis</hi> in theſe latter times] during their minority, that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:124812:58"/> attaining to more maturity, their only care was to glut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in pleaſures and delights: ſo that the whole management of affaires remain'd in the hands of their Mothers, or of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſervants, and Officers.

All which Tyrants are certainly of this condition, that if for the manner of their government they are not blameable: Yet for ſo much as they entered into that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction by tyrannous intruſion, they may juſtly be termed Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants without title.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Tyrants by practiſe, it is not ſo eaſie to deſcribe <note place="margin">Tyrants by practiſe.</note> them as true Kings. For reaſon rules the one, and ſelfe-will the other: the firſt preſcribes bounds to his affections, the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines his deſires within no limits, what is the proper rights of Kings may be eaſily declared, but the outragious inſolencies of Tyrants cannot without much difficulty be expreſs'd. And as a right angle is uniforme, and like to it ſelfe one and the fame. ſo an oblique di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifies it ſelfe into various and ſundry ſpecies: In like manner is juſtice and equity ſimple, and may be deciphered in few words: but injuſtice and injury are divers, and for their ſundry accidents not to be ſo eaſily defin'd; but that more will be omitted then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. Now although there be certaine rules by which theſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants may be repreſented (though not abſolutely to the life:) yet notwithſtanding there is not any more certaine than by conferring and comparing a Tyrants fraudulant ſleights with a Kings vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions.</p>
                  <p>A Tyrant lops off thoſe eares which grow higher then the reſt of the corne, eſpecially where vertue make them moſt conſpicuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eminent, oppreſſeth by calumnies, and fraudulent practiſes, the principall officers of the State, gives out reports of intended conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies againſt himſelf, that he might have ſome colourable pretext to cut them off, witneſſe <hi>Tiberius, Maximinius,</hi> &amp; others, which ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not their own kinſmen, cozens, and brothers.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:124812:58"/>
                  <p>The King on the contrary doth not onely acknowledge, his brothers to be as it were conſorts unto him in the Empire: But alſo holds in the place of brothers all the principall Officers of the Kingdom, &amp; is not aſhamed to confeſſe that of them (inqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as deputed from the generall Eſtates) he holds the Crown.</p>
                  <p>The tyrant advanceth above and in oppoſition to the ancient and worthy Nobility, mean and unworthy perſons; to the end that theſe baſe ſellowes being abſolutely his creatures, might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and apply themſelves to the fulfilling of all his looſe and unruly deſires. The King maintains every man in his Rank, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and reſpects the Grandies as the Kingdomes friends, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their good as well as his own.</p>

Therefore it is that tyrants, although they have ſuch numberleſſe guards about them to drive off throngs of <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 28.</note> people from approaching them, yet cannot all thoſe numbers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from doubts, jealouſies and diſtruſts, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally afflict and terrifie their timerous conſciencese yea in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of their greateſt ſtrength, the tyrannizer of tyrants, fear, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maketh prize of their ſouls, and there triumphs in their affliction.

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:124812:59"/>
                  <p>A Tyrant leaves no deſigne unattempted by which he may fleece his Subjects of their ſubſtance, and turne it to his proper benefit, that being continually troubled in gaining meanes to live, they may have no leaſure nor hope how to regaine their liberty: On the contrary, the King knowes that every good Subjects purſe will be ready to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Common-wealths occaſion, and therefore believes he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of no ſmall treaſure, whilſt through his good governement his Subjects flow in all aboundance.</p>
                  <p>A Tyrant extorts unjuſtly from many to caſt prodigally upon two or three Minions, and thoſe unworthy; hee impoſeth on all: and exacteth from all, to furniſh their ſuperfluous and riotous expences: he builds his owne, and followers fortunes on the ruines of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: he drawes out the peoples blood, by the veines of their means, and gives it preſently to carouſe to his Court-leeches. But a King cuts off from his ordinary expences, to eaſe the peoples neceſſities, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecteth his private ſtate, and furniſheth with all magnificence the publique occaſions; briefely is prodigall of his owne blood, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and maintain the people committed to his care.</p>
                  <p>If a Tyrant as heretofore <hi>Tiberius, Nero, Commodus</hi> and others, did ſuffer his Subjects to have ſome breathing time from unreaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and like ſpunges to gather ſome moyſture, it is but to ſqueeſe them out afterwards to his owne uſe: on the contrary, if a King doe ſometimes open a vaine, and draw ſome blood, it is for the peoples good, and not to be expended at his own pleaſure in any diſſolute courſes. And therefore as the holy Scripture compares the one to a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> ſo doth it alſo reſemble the other to a roaring <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 15.</note>

                     <hi>ſubtleties that Tyrants can poſſibly practiſe: hee doth ſo compoſe his countenance to piety, by that meanes to terrifie the people from conſpiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; who they may well imagine to be eſpecially favoured of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing in all appearance ſo reverently to ſerve him.</hi> He fains alſo to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly affected to the publique good; not ſo much for the love of it, as for feare of his owne ſafety.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore he deſires much to be eſteemed juſt, and loyall in ſome
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:124812:60"/> affaires, purpoſely to deceive and betray more eaſily in matters of greater conſequence: much like thoſe thieves which maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by thefts and robberies, cannot yet long ſubſiſt in their trade, without exerciſing ſome parcell of juſtice in their proceedings. Hee alſo counterfeits the mercifull, but it is in pardoning of ſuch malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, in puniſhing whereof he might more truly gaine the reputation of a pittifull Prince.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeake in a word, that which the true King is, the Tyrant would ſeeme to be, and knowing that men are wonderfully attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with, and inamoured of vertue, hee endeavours with much ſubtilty to make his vices appeare yet masked with ſome ſhadow of vertue: but let him counterfeit never ſo cunningly, ſtill the Fox will be known by his taile: and although he fawne and flatter like a Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, yet his ſnarling and grinning will ever bewray his curriſh kind.</p>

                  <p>A Monarchy hath in this, conformity with an Ariſtocraty, that the moſt able and diſcreet are called to conſultations: Tiranny and Oligarchy accord in this, that their counſels are compoſed of the worſt and moſt corrupted. <hi>And as in the Councell Royall, there may in a fort ſeeme many Kings to have intereſts in the government, ſo in the other on the contrary, a multitude of Tyrants alwayes domineers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Monarchy borrowes of the popular government the aſſemblies of the Eſtates, whither are ſent for Deputies the moſt ſufficient of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Provinces, to deliberate of, and determine matters of State: the tiranny takes this of the Ochlocracie, that if ſhee be not able to hinder the convocation of the Eſtates, yet will ſhe endeavour by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious ſubtilties and pernicious practices, that the greateſt enemies of Order and Reformation of the State be ſent to thoſe Aſſemblies, the which we have known practiſed in our times. In this manner aſſumes the Tyrant the countenance of a King, and tyranny the ſemblance of a Kingdome, and the continuance ſucceeds commonly according to the dexterity wherewith it is managed: yet, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, <hi>we ſhal hardly reade of any tyranny that hath out-laſted a hundred yearee: briefely the King principally regards the publique utility, and a Tyrants chiefeſt care is for his private commodity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſeeing the condition of men is ſuch, that a King is with much
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:124812:60"/> difficulty to be found, that in all his actions only agreeth at the publique good, and yet cannot long ſubſiſt without expreſſion of ſome ſpeciall care thereof, we will conclude that where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths advantage is moſt preferr'd, there is both a lawfull King and Kingdome; and where particular deſignes and private ends prevaile againſt the publique profit, there queſtionleſſe is a Tyrant and tiranny.</p>
                  <p>Thus much concerning Tyrants by practiſe, in the examining whereof wee have not altogether fixed our diſcourſe on the looſe diſorders of their wicked and licentious lives, <note n="a" place="margin">Bartol. in. tract. de tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct de regim.

Now at the laſt we are come as it were by degrees to the chiefe and principall point of the queſtion.

There is beſides this, the civill law, or municipial laws of ſeverall Countreyes which governs the ſocieties of men, by certaine rules, ſome in one manner, ſome in another; ſome ſubmit themſelves to the government of one man, ſome to more; others are ruled by a whole Communalty, ſome abſolutely exclude women from the Royall Throne, others admit them, theſe here chuſe their King deſcended of ſuch a family, thoſe there make election of whom they pleaſe, beſides other cuſtomes practiſed amongſt ſeverall Nations. If therefore any offer either by fraud or force to violate this law, wee are all bound to reſiſt him, becauſe he wrongs that ſociety to which wee owe all that we have, and would runne our Countrey, to the preſervation whereof, all men by nature; by law and by ſolemne oath are ſtrictly obliged: inſomuch that feare or negligence, or bad purpoſes, make us omit

The Law <hi>Julia</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes to death thoſe that raiſe rebellion againſt their Countrey or Prince, hath here no place: for he is no Prince which without any lawfull title invadeth the Common-wealth, or Confines of an other: nor he a rebell which by armes defends his Countrey: but rather to this had relation the Oath which all the youth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> were accuſtomed to take in the Temple of <hi>Aglaura:</hi> I will fight for Religion, for the Lawes, for the Altars, and for our poſſeſſions, either alone or with others, and will doe the utmoſt of my endeavour, to leave to poſteritie our Countrey, at the leaſt in as good eſtate as I found it.

For if whileſt the <hi>Gaules</hi> with much ſilence and vigilancie ſeeke to ſcale and ſurpriſe the <hi>Capitoll,</hi> the Souldiers be drowſie with their former paines, the Watch buried in ſleepe, the dogges fayle to barke: then muſt the geeſe play the Sentinells, and with their gagling noyſe give an alarum. And the Souldiers and Watch ſhall be degraded, yea, and put to death: the geeſe for perpetuall remembrance of this deliverance, ſhall be alwayes ſed in the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll,</hi> and much eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>This of which wee have ſpoken, is to be underſtood of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny not yet firmely rooted, to wit, whilſt a tyrant conſpires, machinates, and layes his plots and practiſes. But if he be once ſo poſſeſſed of the State, and that the people being ſubdued, promiſe and ſweare obedience: the Common-wealth being oppreſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne their authoritie into his hands, and that the Kingdome in ſome formall manner, conſent to the changing of their Lawes: for ſo much certainly as then he hath gained a title which before he wanted, and ſeemes to be as well a legall as actuall poſſeſſor thereof, although this yoke were laid on the peoples necke by compulſion, yet muſt they quietly and peaceably reſt in the will of the Almightie, who at his pleaſure transferres Kingdomes from one Nation to another. Otherways there ſhould be no Kingdome whoſe juridiction might not be diſputed: and it may well chance that he which before was a tyrant without title, having obtained the title of a King, may free himſelfe from any tyrannous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by governing thoſe under him with equitie and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore then as the people of <hi>Jurie</hi> under the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">2 Kings 24. and 25. Ierem. 37.</note> of King <hi>Ezechias</hi> did lawfully reſiſt the invaſion of <hi>Senacherib</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian:</hi> So on the contrary was <hi>Zadechias</hi> and all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:124812:62"/> worthily puniſhed, becauſe that without any juſt occaſion after they had done homage and ſworne fealtie to <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> they riſe in rebellion againſt him. For after promiſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance it is too late to repent: and as in battles every one ought to give teſtimony of his valour, but being taken priſoner, muſt faithfully obſerve Covenants: ſo it is requiſite that the people maintaine their rights by all poſſible meanes: but if it chance that they be brought into the ſubjection of anothers will, they muſt then patiently ſupport the dominion of the Victor. So did <hi>Pompey Cato,</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> and others, performe the parts of good Patriots then when they tooke armes againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſeeking to alter the government of the State; neither can thoſe be juſtly excuſed whoſe baſe feare hindred the happie ſucceſſe of <hi>Pompey</hi> and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers noble deſigner. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelfe is ſaid to have reproved one who rayled on <hi>Cato,</hi> affirming that he carried himſelfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily and exceedingly affected to the greatneſſe of his Countrey in couragiouſly oppoſing the alteration which his contraries ſought to introduce in the Government of the State, ſeeing all innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that nature are ever Authors of much trouble and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, no man can juſtly reprehend <hi>Brutus, Caſſius,</hi> and the reſt, who killed <hi>Caeſar,</hi> before his tyrannicall authoritie had taken any firme rooting. And ſo were there Statues of braſſe ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in honour of them by publick decree at <hi>Athens,</hi> and placed by thoſe of <hi>Harmodius</hi> and <hi>Ariſtogiton,</hi> then when after the diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Caeſar</hi> they retired from <hi>Rome,</hi> to avoyde <hi>Mar: Antonie</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> their revenge. But <hi>Cinna</hi> was certainly guiltie of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who after a legall transferring of the peoples power into the hands of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> is ſaid to conſpire againſt him. Likewiſe when the <hi>Pepins</hi> ſought to take the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> from the <hi>Merovingians;</hi> as alſo when thoſe of the line of <hi>Capet</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſupplant the <hi>Pepins,</hi> any might lawfully reſiſt them without incurring the crime of ſedition: but when by publick counſell and the authoritie of the Eſtates, the kingdome was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from one familie to another, it was then unlawfull to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. The ſame may be ſaid if a Woman poſſeſſe her ſelfe of the Kingdome, which the Salick Law abſolutely prohibites, or if one ſeeke to make a Kingdome meerly elective, hereditary to his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, while thoſe Lawes ſtand in force, and are unr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:124812:63"/> the authoritie of the generall Eſtates, which repreſent the body of the people. Neither is it neceſſary, in this reſpect, to have regard whether faction is the greater, more powerfull or more illuſtrious. Alwayes thoſe are the greater number who are led by paſſion, than thoſe that are ruled by reaſon, and therefore tyranny hath more ſervants than the Common-wealth. But <hi>Rome</hi> is there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of <hi>Pompey,</hi> where the Senate is, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate is where there is obedience to the Lawes, love of libertie, and ſtudious carefulneſſe for the Countries preſervation.

It behoves therefore all true <hi>Romans</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to <hi>Camillus,</hi> and aſſiſt his Enterpriſe with the utmoſt of their power and endeavours. Although <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and all his <note place="margin">Plutarch. in vita Themiſt.</note> able and worthieſt companions leave <hi>Athens,</hi> and put to Sea with a navie of two hundred Gallies, notwithſtanding it cannot be ſaid that any of theſe men are baniſhed <hi>Athens.</hi> But rather as <hi>Themiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But to come to other examples; it follows not that the Church of God muſt needs be alwayes in that place where the Arke of the Covenant is: for the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> may carry the Arke into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Idols. It is no good argument, that becauſe wee ſee the <hi>Roman Eagles</hi> waving in Enſignes, and heare their Legions na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that therefore preſently wee conclude that the Armie of the <hi>Romane</hi> Common-wealth is there preſent: for there is onely and properly the power of the State where they are aſſembled to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the libertie of the Countrey againſt the ravenous oppreſſion of Tyrants, to infranchiſe the people from ſervitude, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the impudency of inſulting flatterers, who abuſe the Princes weakneſſe by oppreſſing his Subjects for the advantaging of their own fortunes, and containe ambitious minds from enlarging their deſires beyond the limits of equitie and moderation. Thus much concerning Tyrants without title. <note place="margin">What may lawfully be done againſt Tyrants by practiſe.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for Tyrants by practiſe, whether they at firſt gained their authoritie by the ſword, or were legally inveſted therewith by a generall conſent: It behooves us to examine this point with much
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:124812:63"/> wary circumſpection. In the firſt place we muſt rememher, that all Princes are born men, and therefore reaſon and paſſion are as hardly to be ſeparated in them, as the ſoule is from the body whileſt the man liveth: We muſt not then expect Princes abſolute in perfection, but rath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r repute our ſelves happy if thoſe that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us be indifferently good. And therefore although the prince obſerve not exact mediocrity in State-affaires, if ſometimes paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over-rule his reaſon, if ſome careleſſe omiſſion make him neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the publick utility, or if he doe not alwayes carefully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute juſtice with equality, or repulſe not with ready valour an invading enemy; he muſt not therefore be preſently declared a tyrant. And certainly, ſeeing he rules not as a God over men, nor as men over beaſts, but is a man compoſed of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of the ſame nature with the reſt: as we would queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe judge that prince unreaſonably inſolent, that ſhould inſult over and abuſe his ſubjects, as if they were bruit beaſts; ſo thoſe people are doubtleſſe as much void of reaſon, which imagine a prince ſhould be compleat in perfection, or expect divine abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in a nature ſo frail and ſubject to imperfection. Put if a prince purpoſely ruine the Common-weale, if he preſumptuouſly pervert and reſiſt legall proceedings, or lawfull rights, if he make no reckoning of faith, covenants, juſtice nor piety, if he proſecute his ſubjects as enemies; briefly, if he expreſſe all or the chiefeſt of thoſe wicked pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctſces we have ſo merly ſpoken of; then we may certainly declare him a tyrant, which is as much as an enemy both to God and men. We doe not therefore ſpeak of a prince leſſe good, but of one abſolute bad; not of one leſſe wiſe, but of one malicious and treacherous; not of one leſſe able ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly to diſcuſſe legall differences, but as one perverſly bent to pervert juſtice and equity; not of an unwarlick, but of one fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly diſpoſed to ruine the people, and ranſack the State. For the wiſdome of a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nate, the integrity of a Judge, the valour of a Captain, may peradventure inable a weak prince to govern well: But a tyrans could be content that all the Nobility, the Councellors of State, and Commanders for the warres, had but one head, that he might rake it off at one blow: thoſe being the proper objects of his diſtruſt and feare, and by conſequence the principall ſubjects on whom he deſires to execute his malice and cruelty. A fooliſh prince, although (to ſpeak according to right
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:124812:64"/> and equity) he ought to be depoſed, yet may he perhaps in ſome ſort be born withall: But a tyrant the more he is tollerated, the more he becomes intollerable.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, as the Princes pleaſure is not alwayes law, ſo many times it is not expedient that the people doe all that which may lawfully be done: for it may often times chance, that the medicine proves more dangerous than the diſeaſe. Therefore it becomes wiſe men to try all wayes before they come to blowes, to uſe all other remedies before they ſuffer the ſword to decide the controverſie. If then thoſe which repreſent the body of the people, foreſee any iunovation or machination againſt the State, or that it be already imbarked into a courſe of perdition, their duty is, firſt to admoniſh the Prince, and not to attend, that the diſeaſe by acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſion of time, and accidents, becomes unrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For tyranny may be properly reſembled unto a Feaver He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick, the which at the firſt is eaſie to be cured, but with much difficulty to be known; but after it is ſufficiently known, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes uncurable. Therefore ſmall beginnings are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerved, and by thoſe whom it concernes diligently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                  <p>If the Prince therefore perſiſt in his violent courſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne frequent admonitions, addreſſing his deſignes onely to that end, that he may oppreſſe at his pleaſure, and effect his own deſires without feare or reſtraint, he then doubtleſſe makes himſelf liable to that deteſted crime of <hi>Tyranny:</hi> and whatſoever either the law, or lawfull authority permits againſt a tyrant, may be lawfully practiſed againſt him. Tyrany is not onely a will, but the chiefe and as it were the complement and abſtract of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. A Tyrant ſubverts the State, pillages the people, layes ſtratagems to intrap their lives, breaks promiſe with all, ſcoffes at the ſacred obligation of a ſolemne oath, and therefore is he ſo much more vile than the vileſt of uſuall malefactors, by how much offences comitted againſt a generality, are worthy of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter puniſhment than thoſe which concern onely particular and private perſons. If Theeves and thoſe that commit ſacriledge, be declared infamous; nay, if they juſtly ſuffer corporall puniſhment by death, can we invent any that may be worthily equivalent for ſo outragious a crime?</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, we have already proved, that all Kings receive
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:124812:64"/> their Royall authority from the people, that the whole people conſidered in one body, is above and greater than the King: and that the King and Emperour are onely the prime and ſupreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and miniſters of the Kingdome and Empire; but the people the abſolute Lord and owner thereof. It therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily followes, that a tyrant is in the ſame manner guilty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the Majeſty of the people, as the Lord of a ſee which felloniouſly tranſgreſſe the conditions of his inveſtitutes, &amp; is liable to the ſame puniſhment, yea and certainly deſerves much more greater than the equity of thoſe lawes inflict on the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. Therefore as <hi>Barclus</hi> ſayes, He may either be depoſed by <note place="margin">In tract. de tyran. &amp; in tract. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gim. civit.</note> thoſe which are, Lords in Soveraignty over him, or elſe juſtly puniſhed according to the Law <hi>Julia,</hi> which codemnes thoſe which offer violence to the publick. The body of the people muſt needs be the Soveraigne of thoſe which repreſent it, which in ſome places are the Electors, Palatines, Peeres; in other, the Aſſembly of the generall Eſtates. And if the tyranny have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuch ſure footing, as there is no other meanes but force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him; then is it lawful for them to call the people to Arms, to inroll and raiſe forces, and to imploy the utmoſt of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and uſe againſt him all advantages and ſtratagems of warre, as againſt the enemy of the Common-wealth, and the diſturber of the publick peace. Briefly, the ſame ſentence may be juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him, as was againſt <hi>Manlius Capitolinus</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Valerius lib. 6. c. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou waſt to me Manlius, when thou didſt tumble down the Ganles that ſealed the Capitole: But ſince thou art now become an enemy, like one of them, thou ſhalt be precipitated down from the ſame place from whence thou formerly tumbledſt thoſe enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Officers of the Kingdome cannot for this be rightly taxed of ſedition: for in a ſedition there muſt neceſſarily concurre but two parts, or ſides, the which peremptorily conteſt together, ſo that it is neceſſary that the one be in the right, and the other in the wrong: That partundoubtedly hath the right on their ſide, which defends the Lawes, and ſtrives to advance the publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <note place="margin">Bart. in tract de Guclph. &amp; Gibell. arg. l. 3.

                  <p>And in this their action wee muſt not eſteeme them as private men and Subjects, but as the repreſentative body of the people, yea and as the Soveraignty it ſelfe, which demands of his Miniſter an account of his adminiſtration.

                  <p>There is ever, and in all places, a mutuall and reciprocall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation betweene the people and the Prince, the one promiſeth to be a good and wiſe Prince, the other to obey faithfully, provided he govern juſtly. The people therefore is obliged to the Prince under condition: the Prince to the people ſimply and purely. Therefore if the Prince faile in his promiſe, the people is exempt from obedience, the contract is made void, the right of obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of no force. Then the King if he governe unjuſtly is perjur'd, and the people likewiſe forſworne if they obey not his lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: but that people is truly acquit from all perfidiouſneſſe,

                  <p>It is therefore permitted the Officers of a Kingdome, either all, <note place="margin">L. 106.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:124812:66"/> points of his charge, to wit, in not communicating unto them the affaires of his adminiſtration, in dealing unfaithfully in his place, in doing any thing to the diſhonour or detriment of his pupill, in imbeſſilling of his goods or eſtate, or if hee be an enemy to his pupill: briefly, if either in regard of the worthleſſeneſſe of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or weakneſſe of his judgment, he be unable well to diſcharge ſo weighty a charge. So alſo are the Peeres and principall Officers of the Kingdome accountable for the government thereof, and muſt both prevent, and if occaſion require, ſuppreſſe the tyranny of the Prince, as alſo ſupply with their care and diligence his inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weakneſſe.</p>

For the Common-wealth was as well committed to their care as to his, ſo that it is not ſufficient for them to diſcharge their owne duty in particular, but it behoves them alſo to containe the Prince within the limits of reaſon. Briefly they have both joyntly and ſeverally promiſed with ſolemn oaths, to advance and procure the profit of the Common-wealth: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though then that he forſweare himſelfe, yet may not they imagine that they are quit of their promiſe, no more then the Biſhops, and Patriarks if they ſuffer an hereticall Pope to ruine the Church: yea they ſhould eſteeme themſelves ſo much the more obliged to the obſerving of their oath: by how much they finde him wilfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ruſh on in his perfidious courſes. But if there be collufion betwixt him and them, they are prevaricators, if they diſſemble
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:124812:66"/> they may juſtly be called forſakers, and traytors: If they deliver not the Common-wealth from tiranny, they may be truly ranckt in the number of Tyrants: as on the contrary they are protectors, tutors, and in a ſort Kings, if they keepe and maintain the State ſafe and intire, which is alſo recommended to their care and cuſtody.</p>
                  <p>Although theſe things are ſufficiently certain of themſelves, yet may they be in ſome ſort confirmed by examples. The Kings of <hi>Canaan</hi> which preſſed the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with a hard, both corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall ſervitude (prohibiting them all meetings and uſe of armes) were certainly Tyrants by practice, although they had ſome pretext of title.

But we muſt yet proceed a little further: There is not ſo mean a Mariner, but muſt be ready to prevent the ſhip-wrack of the veſſell, when either the negligence or wilſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Pilot caſts it into danger. Every Magiſtrate is bound to relieve, and as much as in him lies, to redreſſe the miſeries of the Common-wealth, if he ſhall ſee the Prince, or the principall Officers of State his aſſociates, by their weakneſſe or wickedneſſe, to hazard the ruine thereof. Briefly, he muſt either free the whole kingdome, or at leaſt that portion eſpecially recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his care, from their imminent and incroaching tyranny.

No certainly: The Common wealth was not given in charge to particular perſons conſidered one by one; but on the contrary, particulars even as Papiſts, are recommended to the care of the principall Officers and Magiſtrates; and therefore they are not bound to defend the Common-wealth, which cannot defend themſelves.

                  <p>Furthermore, the prince is not eſtabliſht by private and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, but by all in generall conſidered in one intire bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; whereupon it followes, that they are bound to attend the commandment of all, to wit, of thoſe which are the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body of a kingdom, or of a Province, or of a Citie, or at the leaſt of ſome one of them, before they undertake any thing againſt the prince. For as a pupill cannot bring an action, but being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowd <note place="margin">L. 8. l. 9.

And therefore if they were oppreſt with tributes, and unreaſonable impoſts, if any thing were attempted contrary to covenant and oath, and no Magiſtrate oppoſed thoſe unjuſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they muſt reſt quiet, and ſuppoſe that many times the beſt Phyſitians both to prevent and cure ſome grievous diſeaſe, do appoint both letting blood, evacuation of humors, &amp; lancing of the fleſh; and that the affaires of this world are of that nature, that with much difficulty one evill cannot be remedied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the adventuring if not the ſuffering of another, nor any good be atchieved, without great pains. They have the example of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who during the reigne of <hi>Solomon,</hi> refuſed not to pay thoſe exceſſive taxes impoſed on them, both for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple, and fortifying of the Kingdome, becauſe by a generall conſent they were granted for the promulgation of the glory of God, and for an ornament and deſence of the publick State.</p>
                  <p>They have alſo the example of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who though he were King of Kings, notwithſtanding

If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates themſelves manifeſtly favour the tyranny, or at the leaſt doe not formally oppoſe it; let private men remember the ſaying of <hi>Job, That for the ſinnes of the people God permits by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi>

Briefly, let them bear with bad princes, and pray for better, perſwading themſelves, that an outragious tyranny is to be ſupported as patiently, as ſome exceeding dammage done by the violence of tempeſts, or ſome exceſſive over-flowing waters, or ſome ſuch naturall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents unto the fruits of the earth, if they like not better to change their habitations, by retiring themſelves into ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries.

                  <p>The <hi>Centurians</hi> and men at armes did freely and couragiouſly execute the commandments of the High Prieſt <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> in ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the tyranny of <hi>Athalia.</hi> In like manner all the faithfull and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> tooke part and joyned with the <hi>Machabites,</hi> as well to re-eſtabliſh the true ſervice of God, as alſo to free and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the State from the wicked and unjuſt oppreſſion of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and God bleſſed with happy ſucceſſe their juſt and commendable enterprize. What then? cannot God when he pleaſeth ſtirre up particular and private perſons to ruine a mighty and powerfull ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny?

                  <p>But for as much as in theſe latter times, thoſe miraculous teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies by which God was wont to confirme the extraordinary vocation of thoſe famous Worthies, are now wanting for the moſt part: let the people be advis'd, that in ſeeking to croſſe the Sea dry foote, they take not ſome <hi>Impoſtor</hi> for their guide, that may lead them head-long to deſtruction (as we may read happened to the <hi>Jewes:)</hi> and that in ſeeking freedome from tyranny, he that was the principall inſtrument to diſ-inthrall them, became not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a more inſupportable Tyrant than the former: briefly, leſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to advantage the Common-wealth, they introduce not a common miſery upon all the undertakers, participating therein with divers States of <hi>Italy,</hi> who ſeeking to ſuppreſſe the preſent evill, added an acceſſion of greater, and more intollerable ſervitude.</p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:124812:72"/>
                  <p>Finally, that we may come to ſome period of this third queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Princes are choſen by God, and eſtabliſht by the people: As all particulars conſidered one by one are inferiour to the Prince: ſo the whole body of the people and Officers of State which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that body, are the Princes ſuperiours. In the receiving and inauguration of a Prince, there are Covenants and contracts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between him and the people, which are tacite and expreſſed, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall or civill: to wit, to obey him faithfully whilſt he commands juſtly, that he ſerving the Common-wealth, all men ſhal ſerve him, that whilſt he governs according to law, all ſhall be ſubmitted to his government, &amp;c. The Officers of the Kingdome are the Guardians and Protectors of theſe Covenants and contracts. He that maliciouſly or wilfully violates theſe conditions, is queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a Tyrant by practice. And therefore the Officers of State may judge him according to the lawes: and if he ſupport his tyranny by ſtrong hands, their duty bindes them, when by no other meanes it can be effected, by force of armes to ſuppreſſe him.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe Officers there be two kindes, thoſe which have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally undertaken the protection of the Kingdome: as the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Marſhalls, Peers, Palatines, and the reſt, every one of which, although all the reſt doe either connive or conſort with the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are bound to oppoſe and repreſſe the Tyrant: and thoſe which have undertaken the government of any Province, Citie, or part of the Kingdome, as Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Conſuls, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yors, Sheriffes, &amp;c. they may according to right expell and drive tyranny and Tyrants from their Cities, Confines, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>But particular and private perſons may not unſheath the ſword againſt Tyrants by practiſe, becauſe they were not eſtabliſht by particulars, but by the whole body of the people. But for Tyrants which without title intrude themſelves for ſo much as there is no contract or agreement betweene them and the people, it is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently permitted all to oppoſe and depoſe them; and in this rank of Tyrants may thoſe be rang'd, who, abuſing the weakeneſſe and ſloath of a lawfull Prince, tyrannouſly inſult over his Subjects. Thus much for this, to which for a more full reſolution may be added that which hath beene formerly diſcourſed in the ſecond queſtion.</p>

               <p>VVEe have yet one other queſtion to treat of, in the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing whereof there is more uſe of an equitable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then of animble apprehenſion: and if charity were but in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſonable proportion prevalent amongſt the men of this age, the diſputation thereof were altogether frivolous: but ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in theſe dayes is more rare nor leſſe eſteemed than charity; we will ſpeak ſome-what of this our queſtion. We have already ſufficiently proved that all Tyrants, whether thoſe that ſeeke to captivate the minds and ſoules of the people with an erroneous and ſuperſtitious opinion in matter of Religion, or thoſe that would enthrall their bodies and eſtates with miſerable ſervitude and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive impoſitions, may juſtly by the people be both ſuppreſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſt. But for ſo much as Tyrants are for the moſt part ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and Subjects ſeldome ſo caucelous, that the diſeaſe is hardly known, or at the leaſt not carefully obſerved before the remedy prove almoſt deſperate, nor thinke of their owne defence before they are brought to thoſe ſtraights: that they are unable to defend themſelves, but compeld to implore the aſſiſtance of others: Our demand therefore is, if Chriſtian Princes lawfully may and ought to ſuccour thoſe Subjects which are afflicted for true Religion, or oppreſt by unjuſt ſervitude, and whoſe ſufferings are either for the kingdome of Chriſt, or for the liberty of their own ſtate? There are many, which hoping to advance their owne ends, and encroach on others rights, that will readily embrace the part of the afflicted, and proclaime the lawfulneſſe of it: but the hope of gaine is the certaine and only aime of their purpoſes: And in this manner the <hi>Romans, Alexander</hi> the great, and divers others, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuppreſſe Tyrants, have oftentimes enlarged their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. It is not long ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But if there be ſome appearance of danger, and little expectance of profit, then it is that moſt Princes doe vehemently diſpute the lawfulneſſe of the action. And as the former cover their ambition and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice with the vaile of charity and piety: ſo on the contrary doe the other call their feare and cowardly baſeneſſe integrity and juſtice, although that piety (which is ever carefull of anothers good) love no part in the counſels of the firſt: nor juſtice (which affectionately deſires the eaſing of a neighbours griefe) in cooling the charitable intendments of the later. Therefore without learning either to the one ſide or the other, let us follow thoſe rules which piety and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice trace us out in matter of Religion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, All accord in this, <hi>That there is one only Church, whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the head,</hi> the members whereof are ſo united and conjoyn'd together, that if the leaſt of them be offended or wrongd, they all participate both in the harme and ſorrow, as throughout holy Scripture plainly appeares. Wherefore the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a body: Now it oftentimes happens that the body is not only overthrown by a wound in the arme, or thigh, but even alſo much endangered, yea and ſometimes kill'd by a ſmall hurt in the little finger. Vainly therefore doth any man vaunt that this body is recommended to his care and cuſtody, if he ſuffer that to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and puld in pieces which he might have preſerved whole and intire. The Church is compared to an edifice: on which ſide ſoever the building is undermin'd, it many times chances that the whole tumbles downe, and on what rafter or piece of timber ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the flame takes hold, it indangers the whole houſe of burning, he muſt needs be therefore worthy of ſcome who ſhould deferre to quench the fire which had cautht his houſe top, becauſe he dwels moſt in the Cellar: would not all hold him for a mad man which ſhould neglect by countermining to fruſtrate a myne, becauſe it was intended to overthrow that wall there, and not this here.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Church is reſembled to a ſhip, which as it ſailes together, ſo doth it ſinke together: inſomuch that in a tempeſt, thoſe which be in the fore-caſt, or in the keele, are no more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure than thoſe which remaine at the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:124812:73"/> being granted, queſtionleſſe whoſoever hath not a fellow-feeling in commiſerating the trouble, danger &amp; diſtreſſe of the Church, is no member of that bodie, nor domeſtick in the family of Jeſus Chriſt, nor hath any place in the Ark of the covenant of grace. He w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath any ſenſe of Religion in his heart ought no more to doubt whether he be oblig'd to aid the afflicted members of the Church, than he would be aſſiſted to himſelfe in the like diſtreſſe: for the union of the Church unites us all into one bodie, and therefore every one in his calling muſt be ready to aſſiſt the needy, and ſo much the more willingly, by how much the Almighty hath beſtowed a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter portion of his bleſſings on us: which were not conferr'd, that we ſhould be made poſſeſſors of them, but that we ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers thereof according to the neceſſity of his Saints.</p>
               <p>As this Church is one, ſo is ſhee recommended, and given in charge to all Chriſtian Princes in generall, and to every one of them in particular: For ſo much as it was dangerous to leave the care to one alone, and the unity of it would not by any meanes permit, that ſhe ſhould be divided into pieces, and every portion aſſign'd unto one particular: God hath committed it all intire to particulars, and all the parts of it to all in generall, not only to preſerve and defend it, but alſo to amplifie and encreaſe it as much as might be. Inſomuch that if a Prince which hath undertaken the care of a portion of the Church, as that of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and notwithſtanding neglect and forſake another part that is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and which he might ſuccour, he doubtleſſe abandons the Church, Chriſt having but one only Spouſe, which the Prince is ſo bound to preſerve and defend that ſhe be not violated or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any part if it be poſſible. And in the ſame manner as every private perſon is bound by his humble and ardent prayers to God to deſire the reſtoring of the Church: So likewiſe are the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates tied diligently to procure the ſame with the utmoſt of their power and meanes which God hath put into their hands. For the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is no other than that of <hi>Coloſſus:</hi> but theſe two are portions of the univerſall Church, which is the kingdome of Chriſt, the encreaſe and proſperity whereof ought to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſubject of all private mens prayers and deſires; but it is the duty of all Kings, Princes, and Magiſtrates, not only to amplifie and extend the limits and bounds of the Church in all places, but only to preſerve and defend it againſt all men whatſoever. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

And therefore ridiculous and worthy of puniſhment were that Church-warden which had care onely of ſome ſmall part of the Church, and ſuffered all the reſt to be ſpoiled with raine and weather. In like manner, all Chriſtian Kings when they receive the ſword on the day of their Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſolemnly ſweare to maintaine the Catholick or univerſall Church, and the ceremony then uſed doth fully expreſſe it, for holding the ſword in their hands, they turne to the Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, and brandiſh it, to the end that it may be knowne that no part of the world is excepted. As by this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they aſſume the protection of the Church, it muſt be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe underſtood of the true Church, and not of the falſe: therefore ought they to imploy the utmoſt of their abilitie to reforme and wholly to reſtore that which they hold to be the pure and truely Chriſtian Church, to wit, ordered and governed according to the direction of the Word of God. That this was the practiſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes, we have their examples to inſtruct us.

Now in ſaying thou onely attends thine own affaires, fearing to wrong another, thou falleſt into another kind of injuſtice: for thou abandoneſt humane ſociety, in that thou wile not afford any endeavour either of mind, body, or goods, for the neceſſary preſervation thereof.</hi> Read the Directions of the heathen Philoſophers and Politicians who have written more divinely herein, than many Chriſtians in theſe dayes. From hence alſo proceeds, that the <hi>Roman</hi> law deſignes puniſhment to the neighbour which will not deliver the ſlave from the outragious fury of his maſter.</p>

If he were negligent in performing this duty for the firſt mulct, he was to receive a certaine number of blowes on his body, and to faſt for 3. dayes together.

               <p>Briefly to epitomize what hath bin formerly ſaid if a Prince out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly over-paſs the bounds of piety &amp; juſtice. A neighbor Prince may juſtly and religiouſly leave his owne Countrey, not to invade and uſurp anothers, but to containe the other within the limits of juſtice and equity: and if he neglect or omit his duty herein, hee ſhewes himſelfe a wicked and unworthy Magiſtrace.

And therefore the Ancients have ranckt <hi>Hercules</hi> amongſt the gods, becauſe he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht and tam'd <hi>Procruſtes, Buſiris,</hi> and other Tyrants, the plagues of man kind, and monſters of the earth.
